  "ingredients": [
    "- 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed",
    "- 2 tablespoons canola oil",
    "- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "- 2 fresh pomegranates",
    "- 4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces",
    "- \u00bc cup walnuts, toasted and coarsely chopped"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.",
    "2. Place the Brussels sprouts on a large baking sheet, toss with the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven until just tender when pierced with a knife, 25 to 30 minutes.",
    "3. While the Brussels sprouts are roasting, seed the pomegranates. Cut them in half crosswise, then cut each half in half again. Working over a bowl, use a small spoon or your fingers to gently pull the seeds away from the pulp. (The juice may stain your fingers temporarily, but it washes off easily.)",
    "4. Transfer the sprouts to a large bowl, add the butter, and stir until melted. Stir in the pomegranate seeds and walnuts."
