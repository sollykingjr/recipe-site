  "directions": [
    "Place the butter in a small saucepan, and set over medium-low heat. Stirring constantly, cook until the butter melts and becomes foamy. Continue stirring until the foam subsides and the solids at the bottom of the pan begin to turn brown. Once they have turned a nutty dark brown color\u2014but not black\u2014immediately pour the butter into a small heatproof bowl to stop the cooking process. Place the bowl of butter in the fridge to cool and solidify, about 45 to 60 minutes.",
    "While the butter is cooling, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/177\u00b0C. Using two muffin pans, fill 16 muffin cups with paper liners (see note).",
    "In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.",
    "Transfer the solidified brown butter to a large mixing bowl, and add the sugar. Beat on medium speed until smooth and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition, then the vanilla. Add the flour mixture in three additions, alternating with two additions of the sour cream, stopping to scrape down the sides and beating between each one. Set aside.",
    "In a small bowl, make the crumb topping by mixing together the granulated and brown sugars, chopped walnuts, and cinnamon.",
    "Fill each paper muffin cup about 1/3 full of batter, using about 1 1/2 tablespoons per muffin cup. Smooth the batter to cover the bottom of the cups in an even layer. Sprinkle an even layer of crumb topping over the batter, using 2-3 teaspoons per muffin. Add a second layer of batter over the crumb topping, using another 1 1/2 tablespoons of batter per muffin and smoothing it into an even layer. Top each muffin with another 2-3 teaspoons of crumb topping. When finished, each muffin cup should be about 3/4 full.",
    "Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean with a few crumbs, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer the muffins to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature, and enjoy!"
