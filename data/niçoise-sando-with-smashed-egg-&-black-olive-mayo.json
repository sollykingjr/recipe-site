  "ingredients": [
    "PRODUCE",
    "- 1 garlic clove",
    "- 1 ripe medium tomato",
    "- \u00bd cup basil leaves",
    "DAIRY",
    "- 4 large eggs",
    "PANTRY",
    "- \u2153 cup oil-cured black olives",
    "- 6 tablespoons mayonnaise",
    "- 2 (10-inch) soft hoagie rolls",
    "- 1 (6.7-ounce) jar high-quality oil-packed tuna",
    "- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "- 2 tablespoons red or white wine vinegar",
    "- 2 handfuls potato chips"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Cook the eggs:",
    "- Bring a medium pot of water to a boil.- Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower 4 eggs into the water. Set a timer for 9 minutes.- Meanwhile, fill a medium bowl with ice and water. Once the eggs are cooked, transfer them to the ice bath to chill for at least 5 minutes to stop the cooking.",
    "2. Make the olive mayo:",
    "- Smash \u2153 cup oil-cured black olives with the bottom of a measuring cup and discard the pits.- Finely chop the olives and combine them with 6 tablespoons mayo in a small bowl.- Finely grate 1 garlic clove into the olive mayo and mix well to combine. No need to season this mayo, since oil-cured black olives are inherently very salty.",
    "3. Prep your other elements:",
    "- Cut the hoagie rolls in half lengthwise and pull out some of the bread to hollow them slightly so that the ingredients have somewhere to sit.- Drain the oil from 1 (6.7-ounce) jar of oil-packed tuna.- Slice 1 medium tomato about \u00bc inch thick. Season the slices with salt and black pepper and set on paper towels to drain (no soggy sandwich!). Wipe down that cutting board.",
    "4. Assemble:",
    "- Slather the olive mayo on all 4 hoagie halves, dividing it evenly.- Peel the eggs. Tear each egg into a few pieces, then place them on the bread. Using the back of a fork, smash each egg down so that it sits more evenly on the sandwich. Season the eggs with salt and black pepper.- Layer the sliced tomatoes on the bottom halves of the sandwiches.- Flake apart the tuna and arrange it in an even layer on top of the eggs. Drizzle 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar over the tuna on each sandwich.- Top with some basil leaves, a handful of potato chips, and the top of the hoagie roll. Press down firmly to compress everything.",
    "5. Wrap and serve: Wrap the sandwiches in parchment paper or foil to keep them tidy, then slice each sandwich in half before serving."
