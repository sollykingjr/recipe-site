  "ingredients": [
    "One 5-pound boneless pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch chunks",
    "1tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "1\u00bdteaspoons freshly ground black pepper",
    "2tablespoons vegetable oil",
    "8cups Dashi, chicken stock, water, or a combination"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
    "2 Season the pork with the salt and pepper. Heat a Dutch oven or other large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, then coat with the vegetable oil. Working in batches, sear the pork pieces on all sides. Don\u2019t crowd the pot, or you\u2019ll end up steaming rather than searing the meat. All told, you should spend a good 15 minutes or so, making sure all of the meat gets some good color and removing the pieces to a bowl or plate as they brown. Once all the meat is browned, pour off the fat and return the meat to the pot. Add the dashi, chicken stock, or water and bring to a simmer, then cover the pot and slide it in the oven. Cook for about 2 hours, or until the meat is fork-tender.",
    "3 Reserve one-third of the meat and broth for your first batch of curry. Let the rest of the pork and broth cool to room temperature before portioning it into two plastic containers and freezing it for future curry dinners."
