    "Make the goug\u00e8res dough: Prepare the p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux through the step of beating the eggs into the dough. With the mixer on low, beat in the nutmeg, paprika, salt, and cayenne. Slowly add 6 ounces (170g) of the grated cheese to the bowl a bit at a time, waiting for each addition to incorporate into the batter before adding the next. Reserve the remaining 4 ounces cheese for topping the goug\u00e8res.",
    "Transfer to a pastry bag: Scrape the batter into a large pastry bag or resealable plastic bag. Twist or seal the bag to close, squeezing out as much air as possible. Snip a \u00bd-inch opening in the bag.",
    "Bake the puffs: Follow the directions for preparing the baking sheets and piping plain cream puffs on this page. Brush with the egg, then sprinkle the remaining 4 ounces (113g) grated cheese over top, dividing it evenly between the mounds. Bake and cool as directed for cream puffs."
