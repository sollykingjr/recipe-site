  "ingredients": [
    "2tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed",
    "2tablespoons harissa paste",
    "4garlic cloves, smashed",
    "1large ripe tomato, quartered",
    "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "\u00bccup dry white wine",
    "1\u00bdpounds fresh romano, wax, or green beans, stems trimmed",
    "1cup mixed tender fresh herbs, such as parsley, cilantro, dill, and/or mint",
    "\u00bdcup finely chopped fresh chives",
    "2tablespoons finely grated lemon zest"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Heat the olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the harissa and garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the harissa has started to caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomato and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the tomato begins to break down into a pulpy mash, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the wine and cook until reduced by about half, 2-ish minutes.",
    "2 Add the beans and stir to coat in the spicy tomato-y business. Season with salt and pepper, reduce the heat to medium-low, and place the lid on top. Let them do their thing in there for 15 to 20 minutes before stirring. Continue cooking until the beans are starting to turn a more olive, army green color and are delightfully softened but not yet mushy, 10 to 15 minutes more. Top with the herbs and lemon zest before serving."
