    "1. Preheat the broiler to high. Trim all but \u00bd inch of stem from the beets and any long roots. Leave the peel in place. Plunge into a large saucepan of boiling water, bring back to a boil, then simmer briskly for about 30 minutes, or until the beets are just tender. Drain and let cool a little.",
    "2. Meanwhile, broil the bacon for 4\u20135 minutes, turning once, until crisp. Blot with paper towels and slice widthwise into bite-size pieces. Set aside and keep warm.",
    "3. Whisk together the dressing ingredients in a pitcher and set aside.",
    "4. When the beets are cool enough to handle, remove the peel, leaving the stem in place and being careful to avoid damaging the flesh. Using a sharp knife, slice the beets in half lengthwise.",
    "5. Arrange the spinach leaves on a serving platter or individual plates. Whisk the dressing again and spoon a little over the leaves. Arrange the beets attractively on top and pour the remaining dressing over them. Scatter with the cheese, bacon, and nuts, finishing with a sprinkling of chives."
