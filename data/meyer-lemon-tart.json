    "Special Equipment: 9-inch removable-bottom tart pan or 9-inch springform pan, instant-read thermometer, food processor (for the Sweet Tart Dough)",
    "Lemon Curd, Meyer Lemon Variation (this page) \u2460",
    "\u00bdcup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt (4.2 oz / 120g)",
    "Sweet Tart Dough (this page), parbaked in a 9-inch removable-bottom tart or springform pan and cooled",
    "\u2153cup raspberry or blackberry jam (3.5 oz / 100g)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Mix the filling: In a medium bowl, whisk the curd and yogurt until smooth. Cover the bowl and set aside to allow the filling to come to room temperature.",
    "Preheat the oven: Arrange an oven rack in the center position and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
    "Bake the jam layer: Place the parbaked tart crust on a foil-lined baking sheet. Spread the jam evenly across the bottom of the tart, working it all the way to the sides. Bake just until the jam is set, 5 to 7 minutes (this layer creates a seal between the curd and the crust so the latter stays crisp). Remove the tart from the oven. (Leave the oven on.)",
    "Fill and bake the tart: Scrape the filling into the hot crust to the very top, then use an offset spatula to smooth the surface. (Depending on the height of your crust, you may have a tiny bit of curd left over; save it for another use. \u2461) Carefully transfer the tart to the oven and bake until the filling is set and puffed around the edges and the center wobbles gently (it will wobble as a cohesive mass, not ripple), 28 to 33 minutes.",
    "Cool and chill the tart: Let the tart cool completely on a wire rack before removing the ring. Place the tart on a serving plate and chill until cold, at least 1 hour. Slice and serve."
