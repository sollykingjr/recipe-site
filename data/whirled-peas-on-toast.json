  ],
  "directions": [
    "To whirl those peas: Combine the peas and blender sauce in a food processor and pulse about ten times, just to mix the ingredients and chop the peas a bit, so there aren\u2019t any whole peas hanging around.",
    "To make those toasts: Get a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet or griddle hot over medium heat. Swipe the butter on each side of the bread and toast in batches in the skillet until both sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. When they\u2019re done, move them to a rack or stand them up so they lean against each other, to keep from getting soggy.",
    "When the bread is cool enough to handle, swipe each slice with the cream cheese, then cut the toasts in half\u2014I\u2019m a triangle guy, so I do corner to corner.",
    "Spoon on all of the whirled peas (it\u2019ll only seem like too much until you taste it), then sprinkle on the onion, herbs, and almonds. Finally, squeeze on the juice from about half the lemon if it\u2019s super-juicy, or more if it\u2019s not.",
    "Eat it.",
    "Feta Cream Cheese",
    "Combine the feta and salt in a food processor, then add the cream cheese in several blobs (it\u2019s easier on your machine that way). Buzz, occasionally stopping and scraping down the sides if need be, until it\u2019s smooth and there are no signs of little pebbly chunks of feta. It\u2019ll take 2 to 3 minutes, depending on how soft your cream cheese was.",
    "It keeps in the fridge until the expiration date on the feta or cream cheese."
