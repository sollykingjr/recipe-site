  "ingredients": [
    "- 5 ounces yuba (tofu skins), preferably the Hodo Soy brand",
    "- 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine, dry sake, or white wine",
    "- 2 tablespoons soy sauce",
    "- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar",
    "- 1 teaspoon Mushroom Seasoning Powder, homemade or store-bought",
    "- \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt",
    "- 1 tablespoon roughly chopped garlic",
    "- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, plus 1 teaspoon for garnish",
    "- 1 teaspoon ground cumin, plus 1 teaspoon for garnish",
    "- 1 tablespoon olive oil",
    "- 1 medium long green chili, halved lengthwise and cut into 1-inch pieces",
    "- \u00bd medium red onion, sliced into thin half-moons",
    "- A handful roughly chopped cilantro",
    "- Chili Oil, homemade or store-bought"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Gently unfold the yuba, pull apart the sheets, and slice into long 1-inch wide ribbons. Set them aside. Combine the Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, sugar, mushroom seasoning powder, salt, and 3 tablespoons water in a small mixing bowl, stir well, and set aside.",
    "2. Combine the garlic, cumin seeds, ground cumin, and olive oil in the skillet and set it over medium-high heat. When the garlic starts to sizzle, give it a stir and cook until you can smell the garlic but it hasn\u2019t browned, 30 to 45 seconds.",
    "3. Add the Shaoxing wine mixture and cook, swirling the pan, for 5 seconds. Add the chili and onion, stir for 10 seconds, then add the yuba and cook, tossing frequently, until the yuba is coated in sauce, about 1 minute. You might need to add a tablespoon or two of water to help the sauce coat the yuba, though there shouldn\u2019t be any sauciness in the pan.",
    "4. Transfer to a platter, top with the cilantro and the whole and ground cumin, then drizzle on some chili oil."
