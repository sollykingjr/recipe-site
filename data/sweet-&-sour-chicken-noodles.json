  "ingredients": [
    "2x 7-oz chicken thighs, skin on, bone in",
    "5oz fine rice noodles",
    "7oz sugar snap peas",
    "2tablespoons Worcestershire sauce",
    "2teaspoons chili jam"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Pull the skin off the chicken. Place the skin in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat to render and get golden, turning occasionally. Cut the bones out of the thighs and chuck into the pan for bonus flavor, then chop the meat into \u00c2\u00be-inch pieces. Move the skin and bones to one side of the pan, then add the meat alongside and cook for 5 minutes, or until golden, stirring occasionally. Once crispy, remove, chop, and reserve the skin, discarding the bones.",
    "Meanwhile, cook the noodles in boiling salted water according to the package instructions. Halve the sugar snaps lengthways. Once soft, drain the noodles, reserving a cupful of cooking water, then refresh under cold water. Use scissors to snip the noodles into roughly 3-inch lengths.",
    "Stir the Worcestershire sauce and chili jam into the chicken pan and let the jam melt, then add the sugar snaps and noodles. Toss over the heat for 2 minutes, adding a splash of reserved noodle water to loosen, if needed. Taste and season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, then dish up and sprinkle over the reserved crispy chicken skin."
