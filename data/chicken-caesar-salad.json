    "1. For the dressing Whisk lemon juice and garlic together in medium bowl and let sit for 10 minutes.",
    "2. Transfer vegetable oil and olive oil to small measuring cup so that they are easy to pour. Whisk anchovies, egg yolks, and Worcestershire into lemon mixture. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle oil mixture into bowl until dressing is emulsified. If pools of oil gather on surface as you whisk, stop addition of oil and whisk mixture well to combine, then resume whisking in oil in slow stream. Dressing should be glossy and lightly thickened, with no surface pools of oil. Whisk in Parmesan and season with pepper and extra lemon juice to taste.",
    "3. For the salad Toss lettuce with croutons, \u00be cup Parmesan, and two-thirds of dressing in large bowl until well combined. Divide dressed lettuce among individual plates. Toss chicken with remaining dressing. Divide chicken equally among plates and season with pepper. Serve immediately, passing remaining \u00bc cup Parmesan separately."
