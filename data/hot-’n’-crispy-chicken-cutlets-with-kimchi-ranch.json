  "directions": [
    "\u2460 Marinate the chicken:",
    "\u2726In a medium bowl, whisk together \u00bc cup labneh, 3 tablespoons kimchi brine, 1 tablespoon onion powder, and 1\u00bc teaspoons cayenne pepper.",
    "\u2726Pat 2 chicken breasts dry and slice each in half lengthwise to create 2 thin cutlets. Season the cutlets all over with 2 teaspoons salt and transfer to the marinade, turning to coat. Marinate the chicken at least 15 minutes at room temperature and up to 8 hours in the fridge.",
    "\u2461 Make the kimchi ranch:",
    "\u2726In a small bowl, whisk together \u00bd cup mayonnaise, 2 teaspoons onion powder, and \u00bd cup labneh.",
    "\u2726Finely grate 1 garlic clove and zest half of a lemon into the labneh-mayo mixture. Cut the lemon into wedges and set them aside for serving.",
    "\u2726Thinly slice half of the chives and stir them into the ranch. Slice the remaining chives on the bias into 1\u00bd-inch(ish)-long matchsticks for garnishing later.",
    "\u2726Finely chop \u00be cup kimchi and stir it into the ranch. If it looks a little thick, add a splash or two of water until it is swooshable and spreadable. Season with salt.",
    "\u2462 Heat the oil: In a large Dutch oven, heat 2 cups neutral oil over medium heat; the oil should be about 1\u00bd inches deep. It\u2019s ultimately going to need to reach about 400\u00b0F, so use a deep-frying thermometer to check from time to time and adjust the heat as needed to maintain that temp. If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, throw a few pieces of panko in the oil, and if they sizzle like cray, you\u2019re in the right ballpark for frying.",
    "\u2463 Bread the chicken:",
    "\u2726Place 2 cups panko in a medium bowl.",
    "\u2726Working one at a time, use tongs to dip each chicken cutlet into the panko and use your fingers to press and pack the panko onto the chicken until very well coated. Transfer to a plate.",
    "\u2464 Fry the chicken:",
    "\u2726Line a rimmed baking sheet or a large plate with paper towels.",
    "\u2726Once the oil reaches 400\u00b0F, working in 2 batches, fry the chicken cutlets until deeply golden brown all over, flipping halfway through, 3 to 5 minutes per side.",
    "\u2726Transfer the cutlets to the paper-towel-lined baking sheet and season well with salt. Transfer the cutlets to a cutting board and slice across the grain (perpendicular to the point of the breast) into \u00bd-inch-thick pieces.",
    "\u2465 Plate \u2019em up: Spread some kimchi ranch on each plate, add the cutlets and the remaining 1\u00bc cups kimchi, top with the reserved chives, and serve extra ranch alongside.",
