    "1  For the chicken: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Halve chicken horizontally, then cover chicken halves with plastic wrap and use meat pounder to pound cutlets to even \u00bc-inch thickness. Season both sides of each cutlet with salt and pepper.",
    "2  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place 4 cutlets in skillet and cook, without moving, until browned, about 2 minutes. Using spatula, flip cutlets and continue to cook until second sides are opaque, 15 to 20 seconds. Transfer to large heatproof plate. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to now-empty skillet and repeat with remaining cutlets. Cover plate loosely with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm while making sauce.",
    "3  For the sauce: Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. (If necessary, add oil to equal 1 tablespoon). Add shallot and cook over medium heat until softened, about 1 minute. Adjust heat to medium-high and add cider and vinegar. Bring to simmer, scraping pan bottom with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Simmer until reduced to \u00bd cup, 6 to 7 minutes. Off heat, stir in mustard and parsley, then whisk in butter 1 tablespoon at a time. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve immediately with cutlets."
