Add the meats and cook until browned, 6\u20138 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce and peas. Dissolve estratto in wine, then add to the pan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool completely, at least 1 hour or overnight in the fridge.",
    "2. Cook the rice: In a medium saucepan, heat olive oil over medium. Saut\u00e9 onion until softened, about 8 minutes. Stir in rice to coat. Add water and bring to a boil. Add saffron, stir, cover, and remove from heat. Let sit until tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir in cheese, season to taste, and spread on a sheet pan to cool.",
    "3. Prepare the coating: In a dish, whisk flour, water, and eggs until smooth. Spread bread crumbs in a second dish. Dust a baking sheet with bread crumbs. Keep a bowl of cold water nearby.",
    "4. Shape the arancine: With wet hands, scoop \u00bc cup rice into your palm. Press to form a hollow center. Add 1 tablespoon filling and close rice around it. Shape into a ball the size of a small orange. Roll in egg mixture, then bread crumbs. Place on the prepared pan. Repeat with remaining ingredients.",
    "5. Fry the arancine: Heat 2 inches of oil in a heavy pot over medium-high heat. Line a plate with paper towels. Fry arancine in batches until golden, about 3 minutes, turning and basting to cook evenly. Drain on the paper towels.",
    "6. Serve hot."
