    "- \u00be cup short-grain white rice"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. SOAK the rice in cold water for 20 minutes, then drain well.",
    "2. HEAT a 10-inch nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over high heat, let it get hot, then add \u00be cup water. Let it boil, stir in the rice, then cook uncovered until the water has completely evaporated, about 3 minutes.",
    "3. STARTING from the center of the rice, use a metal spoon to both spread and firmly press the rice to form a thin layer that covers the bottom and about 1 inch up the sides of the skillet. Continue to cook over high heat, without messing with it, until the edges start to pull away from the skillet and you can lift the whole thing from the pan in one piece, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn off the heat.",
    "4. SLIDE a spatula under the rice bowl to remove it, running a spoon along the edges to loosen them if necessary. Serve crispy side up, warm or at room temperature."
