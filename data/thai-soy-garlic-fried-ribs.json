  "ingredients": [
    "1rack baby back pork ribs (12 to 14 ribs), separated into individual ribs",
    "2tablespoons soy sauce",
    "7cloves garlic, finely minced",
    "1teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
    "2quarts vegetable oil, for deep-frying",
    "Pepper\u2019s Red-Hot Pepper Sauce (recipe follows), for serving"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Put the ribs in a large bowl. Add the soy sauce, garlic, and pepper and toss to coat. Let stand at room temperature.",
    "Heat the oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat to 370\u00b0F. (Use a deep-fry thermometer or test the oil by throwing in a little piece of bread or some bread crumbs; if they sizzle immediately but aren\u2019t burning, you\u2019re ready.) Working in batches of 4 or 5, fry the ribs until just cooked and well browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Bring the oil back to 370\u00b0F between batches and try to skim out any stray bits of garlic so they don\u2019t burn in the oil and make it taste like burnt garlic.",
    "Serve with Pepper\u2019s red-hot pepper sauce or just watch your baby chew on them with nothing at all!"
