    "\u00bdcup granulated chicken bouillon (preferably Totole brand, see this page; optional but optimal)",
    "\u00bccup kosher salt (Diamond Crystal or about half as much Morton)"

  "directions": [
    "You want the chicken bouillon to be the texture of sand, so grind it up however you like (spice grinder, mortar and pestle, put it in a sealed bag and whack it). No biggie if it\u2019s a little too coarse or too fine. Stir it together with the salt.",
