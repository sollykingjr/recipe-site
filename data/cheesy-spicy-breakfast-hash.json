  "directions": [
    "In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the potatoes and 1 inch of water. Cover and cook on high until the potatoes are partially cooked, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain the potatoes and set aside.",
    "Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering-hot. Add the onion, garlic, bell pepper, and jalape\u00f1os and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent and the peppers are softened, about 8 minutes.",
    "Reduce the heat to medium, then stir in the potatoes, 1 teaspoon salt, the black pepper, and paprika. Pour the broth into the skillet and cook, stirring only once in a while, until the potatoes are cooked, the whole mess is golden and crispy things happen, about 15 minutes.",
    "Taste and add more salt if it\u2019s not already super delicious. Sprinkle with the cheese, cover, and cook until the cheese is melted, another 3 to 4 minutes. Serve with the eggs and hot sauce, of course."
