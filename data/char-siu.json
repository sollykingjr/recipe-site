  "ingredients": [
    "- 1 (4- to 4 1/2-pound) boneless pork butt roast",
    "- 1 cup soy sauce",
    "- 1/2 cup sugar",
    "- 1/2 cup hoisin sauce",
    "- 1/4 cup mei kuei lu chiew (rose cooking liquor)",
    "- 1/4 cup grated fresh ginger",
    "- 1/4 cup Chinese sesame paste",
    "- 1 1/2 tablespoons (1 1/4 ounces) red or white fermented bean curd, mashed to paste, plus 2 teaspoons fermented bean curd liquid",
    "- 4 garlic cloves, minced",
    "- 1 tablespoon red food coloring (optional)",
    "- 2 teaspoons five-spice powder",
    "- 1/2 teaspoon white pepper",
    "- 1/8 teaspoon pink curing salt #1 (optional)",
    "- 1/2 cup maltose"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Cut the pork crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick steaks. Divide the pork between 2 one-gallon zipper-lock bags. Whisk together soy sauce, sugar, hoisin, mei kuei lu chiew, ginger, sesame paste, fermented bean curd and liquid, garlic, food coloring (if using), five-spice powder, and pepper in a bowl until smooth. Measure out and reserve 1 cup of the marinade. Whisk the pink curing salt (if using) into the remaining marinade. Divide it equally between the bags and rub to distribute evenly over the pork. Press out as much air as possible from the bags, seal, and refrigerate for at least 10 hours or up to 16 hours.",
    "2. While the pork marinates, cook the maltose with the reserved marinade in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the glaze is reduced to 1 cup, about 4 to 6 minutes. (Glaze can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)",
    "3. Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and set a wire rack in the sheet. Spray the rack with vegetable oil spray.",
    "4. Remove the pork from the marinade, letting any excess drip off, and place it on the prepared rack. Bake until the pork registers 165 degrees, about 25 to 30 minutes. Let the pork rest on the rack for 10 minutes.",
    "5. Heat the broiler. Brush both sides of the pork with half of the glaze. Broil until the top is mahogany, about 2 to 4 minutes. Flip the pork and broil until the second side is mahogany, about 2 to 4 minutes. Brush both sides with the remaining glaze and continue to broil until the top is dark mahogany and lightly charred, about 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer the pork to a carving board, charred side up, and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice the pork crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick strips and serve."
