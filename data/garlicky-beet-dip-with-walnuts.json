  "ingredients": [
    "1pound beets or carrots, tops removed and scrubbed, or sweet potatoes",
    "\u2153cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling",
    "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1garlic clove, finely grated",
    "\u2153cup walnuts, hazelnuts, or almonds, toasted (see this page)",
    "2tablespoons red wine vinegar or white wine vinegar, plus more as needed",
    "\u00bdcup sour cream or full-fat Greek yogurt (optional)",
    "\u00bccup fresh dill, coarsely chopped",
    ""
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.2 Place the beets in a large baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast until totally and completely fork-tender, 60 to 70 minutes, depending on size. (If you\u2019re doing this with sweet potatoes, they\u2019ll take about the same amount of time; carrots will take less time\u201440 to 45 minutes.)3 Remove from the oven and let cool enough so that you can peel them, then cut into smaller chunks.4 Place the beets, garlic, nuts, olive oil, and the vinegar in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until you\u2019ve got the texture of your dreams, which is different for all of us. For me, it\u2019s not perfectly smooth but processed enough to spread. If you like chunkier or smoother, then go for it.5 Once your desired texture is reached, fold in the sour cream, if using. Season with salt, pepper, and more vinegar. Transfer to your cutest bowl, drizzle with more olive oil, and top with dill."
