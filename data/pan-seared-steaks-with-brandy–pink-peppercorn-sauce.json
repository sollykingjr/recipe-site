  "directions": [
    "1. Pat steaks dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt. Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add steaks and cook, without moving them, until well browned on the first side, about 4 minutes. Flip steaks and continue to cook, without moving, until well browned on the second side and meat registers 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 3 to 7 minutes. Transfer steaks to a plate, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest while preparing the sauce.",
    "2. Pour off all fat from the skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter in the now-empty skillet, add shallot, and cook over medium heat until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Off heat, carefully add brandy, scraping up any browned bits.",
    "3. Stir in broth and peppercorns and return skillet to medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced to \u2153 cup, 4 to 6 minutes. Off heat, whisk in remaining 3 tablespoons butter, 1 piece at a time, until melted and sauce is thickened and glossy. Whisk in vinegar and any accumulated steak juices. Season with salt to taste. Serve steaks with sauce."
