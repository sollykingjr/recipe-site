    "1. Process shio koji in blender until smooth, about 30 seconds. Reserve 3 tablespoons blended shio koji in airtight container in refrigerator. Transfer remaining blended shio koji to large stockpot or large plastic container and whisk in water, sugar, and 1\u00bd cups salt until dissolved. Add turkey parts to brine, cover, and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 16 hours.",
    "2. Remove turkey parts from brine and pat dry with paper towels; set aside at room temperature. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.",
    "3. Toss potatoes, carrots, shallots, 2 tablespoons oil, salt, and 2 tablespoons reserved shio koji in large bowl to combine. Sprinkle with \u00bc teaspoon pepper. Arrange vegetables on prepared sheet and top with wire rack (rack will rest on vegetables). Arrange thyme sprigs in single layer on rack. Whisk melted butter and remaining 1 tablespoon shio koji until combined; set aside.",
    "4. Place turkey parts on prepared rack, skin side up, and brush skin with remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle with remaining \u00bd teaspoon pepper and cover loosely with foil. Roast for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue to roast for 25 minutes. Rotate sheet, brush skin with shio koji\u2013butter mixture (if butter mixture has solidified, reheat in microwave for 10 to 20 seconds), and roast until breast registers 155 degrees and thighs register 170 degrees, 25 to 45 minutes, removing pieces as they come to temperature. (If any portions of the turkey skin are browning too rapidly, re-cover them with foil.) Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees.",
    "5. Transfer turkey to carving board, tent with foil, and let rest for 30 minutes. Remove rack and continue to roast vegetables until vegetables are tender and potatoes are spotty brown, about 30 minutes, stirring halfway through. Transfer vegetables to serving bowl. Carve turkey and transfer to serving platter. Serve."
