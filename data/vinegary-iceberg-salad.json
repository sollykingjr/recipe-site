    "1. Prepare the dressing: Add the vinegar, sugar, salt, oregano, and pepper to a medium bowl, and whisk to combine. Stream in the olive oil while whisking continuously. (The dressing doesn\u2019t have to be perfectly emulsified; a broken vinaigrette is just fine here.)",
    "2. Make the salad: Add the iceberg, radishes, cucumbers, and carrot to a large bowl. Toss with your desired amount of dressing, saving any extra for another salad or for serving on the side. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "3. Transfer the salad to a large platter, and top with the tomatoes and basil. Drizzle with a bit more olive oil, sprinkle with a few cracks of pepper, and serve."
