  "ingredients": [
    "- 2 heads garlic",
    "- 1 lemon",
    "- 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter",
    "- 1 pound (size U10 or U15) shell-on shrimp",
    "- 1 (14.5-ounce) can white beans (such as cannellini or navy)",
    "- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "- Warm crusty bread, for serving"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Do some prep:- Thinly slice 20 garlic cloves.- Cut 1 lemon in half. Thinly slice half of the lemon crosswise into rounds, discarding any seeds that cling to the rounds. Reserve the other half for squeezing.- Drain and rinse 1 (14.5-ounce) can of white beans in a fine-mesh strainer.- Pat 1 pound of shrimp dry with paper towels. Season all over with 1 teaspoon salt.",
    "2. Cook the shrimp:- Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons butter and swirl to melt. Add the shrimp in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until lightly golden brown and crisp underneath, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the shrimp and cook just until pink, 1 minute longer. Season with lots and lots of black pepper. (We\u2019re talking many cranks.) Transfer the shrimp to a serving dish.",
    "3. Reduce the heat to very low and add 6 tablespoons butter, the sliced garlic, and the lemon slices. Cook, stirring constantly, until the garlic is very fragrant and softened, just barely beginning to turn brown at the edges, 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "4. Stir in the drained beans. Season with salt and more black pepper and cook, stirring, until the beans are warmed through, about 2 minutes.",
    "5. Pour the garlicky beans over the shrimp. Squeeze the remaining \u00bd lemon over everything and serve with bread for soaking up all that garlic butter."
