  "directions": [
    "1. Cut each chicken breast in half crosswise, then cut thick half in half horizontally, creating 3 cutlets of similar thickness. Pound cutlets to uniform \u00bd-inch thickness. Place cutlets in bowl and toss with salt and pepper. Set aside for 15 minutes.",
    "2. Halve 1 lemon lengthwise. Trim ends from 1 half, halve lengthwise again, then cut crosswise into \u00bc-inch-thick slices; set aside. Juice remaining half and whole lemon and set aside 3 tablespoons juice.",
    "3. Spread flour in shallow dish. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge cutlets in flour, shaking gently to remove excess. Place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place 6 cutlets in skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook until golden brown on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Return cutlets to wire rack. Repeat with 2 tablespoons oil and remaining 6 cutlets; return to wire rack.",
    "4. Add remaining 1 teaspoon oil and shallot to skillet and cook until softened, 1 minute. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add broth, reserved lemon juice, and reserved lemon slices and bring to simmer, scraping up any browned bits.",
    "5. Add cutlets to sauce and simmer for 4 minutes, flipping halfway through simmering. Transfer cutlets to platter. Sauce should be thickened to consistency of heavy cream; if not, simmer 1 minute longer. Off heat, whisk in butter, 1 piece at a time. Stir in capers and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over chicken and serve."
