    "1. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F.2. Toast the walnuts: Spread the walnuts out on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven until deeply golden brown throughout, 8 to 10 minutes. Check to be sure they\u2019re toasted all the way through by cracking into one. Let the walnuts cool.3. Make the dressing:- Finely grate the zest of about a quarter of a lemon into a large serving bowl. Cut the lemon in half and add the juice from both halves to the bowl.- Finely grate 1 small garlic clove into the lemon juice.- Whisk in \u00bd cup full-fat cottage cheese, 3 tablespoons olive oil, and lots of black pepper. Season the dressing with salt.4. Prep and assemble the salad:- Cut 2 Persian cucumbers on a bias, rotating the cucumbers as you cut to create 1-inch oblique spears.- Chop the toasted walnuts.- Trim off the root end of 4 heads of Little Gems and discard any floppy or bruised outer leaves. Separate the leaves from each head. Tear any large leaves in half, leaving the cute little ones whole (rip big romaine leaves in half or into thirds). Wash and dry them thoroughly; transfer to the bowl with the dressing and toss.- Tear 1 cup dill leaves into smaller pieces and add to the bowl along with the cucumbers and walnuts, tossing everything until all the leaves are well coated. Season the salad with more salt and black pepper as needed. Serve it up."
