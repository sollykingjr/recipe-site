    "Add the egg and vanilla and mix for another 2 minutes.",
    "Mix in the flour and baking soda until just combined, being careful not to over mix.",
    "Chill the dough for 30 minutes.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350 and line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper.",
    "Use a 3 TBSP ice cream scoop to portion the dough into 10 cookie dough balls. Roll the dough into a ball in your hands and then place on the cookie sheet \u2013 5 cookies per tray.",
    "Use your fingertips to flatten the dough balls slightly.",
    "Bake for 10 minutes at 350, then allow to cool on the hot cookie sheets for 3-4 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.",
    "While the cookies cool, melt the chocolate with the cream in the microwave in 20 second increments until smooth. Warm up the peanut butter just a bit so it\u2019s easier to spread. Chop up the peanut butter cups.",
    "Once cookies are mostly cool, spread about 1 TBSP of the melted chocolate on top of each cookie, then add about 1 tsp of peanut butter and swirl it into the chocolate with a spoon or offset spatula. Top with chopped peanut butter cups."
