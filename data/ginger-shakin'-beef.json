  "ingredients": [
    "10oz strip loin steak (ideally about \u00be inch thick)",
    "1\u00bd-inch piece of fresh gingerroot",
    "1tablespoon white miso paste",
    "2teaspoons liquid honey",
    "2bok choy (8 oz)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Pull the fat off the strip loin, finely slice the fat, and place it in a cold non-stick frying pan. Put on a medium-high heat to crisp up while you peel and matchstick the ginger, then add that to crisp up, too. Cut off the sinew, then dice the steak into 1\u00bc-inch chunks and toss with the miso until well coated. Scoop the crispy fat and ginger out and put aside, then add the steak chunks to the pan. Cook for 4 minutes, tossing regularly, then drizzle in the honey and 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar. Toss for 1 more minute until shiny and sticky.",
    "Meanwhile, halve the bok choy, cook in a pan of boiling water for just 1 minute so they retain a bit of crunch, then drain well and plate up. Spoon over the steak and sticky juices from the pan, and finish with the reserved crispy bits."
