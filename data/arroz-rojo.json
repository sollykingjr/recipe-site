    "In a blender, puree the tomatoes, onion, and garlic. Set aside.",
    "In a large saut\u00e9 pan with a tight-fitting lid, heat the oil over medium heat. When hot, add the rice and cook, stirring regularly, until the grains become translucent. This takes about 4 to 5 minutes.",
    "Stir in the pureed tomato mixture. Cook until the liquid is reduced and the mixture is somewhat dry, looking about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the broth, salt, peas, carrots, and parsley and stir thoroughly. Top with the chiles, cover, and cook over the lowest heat setting for 15 minutes.",

    "Uncover and allow the rice to cool for 15 more minutes. This will allow it to achieve the perfect fluff.",
