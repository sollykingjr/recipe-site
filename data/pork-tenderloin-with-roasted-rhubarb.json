    "1 3/4-pound boneless pork tenderloin",
    "Olive oil",
    "1teaspoon sea salt flakes",
    "1/2teaspoon black pepper",
    "10small sprigs of rosemary",
    "1/2cup chicken stock",

    "1tablespoon honey"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Using the tip of a sharp knife, score the fat, but not the flesh, of the pork at 1/2-inch intervals. Tie the meat with kitchen twine to form a neat roll. You can ask your butcher to do both of these.",
    "2. Place the meat in a small roasting pan. Rub with oil, and then with the sea salt and black pepper, rubbing them in well. Insert the rosemary sprigs into the slits in the fat. Roast in the preheated oven for 40 minutes.",
    "3. Pour in the stock. Arrange the rhubarb around the meat and drizzle with the honey. Roast for another 10\u201315 minutes, until the rhubarb is tender and starting to color at the edges.",
    "4. Transfer the pork and rhubarb to a warm serving platter, reserving the pan juices. Make a tent over the meat with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes in a warm place.",
    "5. Place the roasting pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Let bubble rapidly to reduce the pan juices, including any that have flowed from the meat, for 3\u20134 minutes, until slightly thickened. Check the seasoning, strain into a pitcher, and serve with the meat."
