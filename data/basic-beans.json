  "ingredients": [
    "1pound dried beans of choice (large white lima beans are my favorite)",
    "Extra-virgin olive oil",
    "1small yellow onion, halved lengthwise",
    "\u00bcteaspoon red pepper flakes",
    "2sprigs of fresh rosemary",
    "1bay leaf",
    "1head of garlic, halved crosswise",
    "1Parmesan cheese rind (optional, but delicious)",
    "Diamond Crystal kosher salt"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. In a large Dutch oven or soup pot, combine the beans with water to cover by 2 inches; get ready for them to expand as they soak. Cover and soak for 6 hours or up to overnight. When you\u2019re ready to cook, drain the beans in a colander and rinse out the Dutch oven.",
    "2. Return the beans to the pot and add 2 tablespoons olive oil, the onion, pepper flakes, rosemary, bay leaf, garlic, Parmesan rind (if using), and 10 cups water. Bring to a boil, then add 1 tablespoon salt. Turn the heat to a simmer, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. Check for doneness and add another 1 tablespoon salt. Cover and cook until the beans are tender and creamy, without any shrively skin or tough bite, another 20 to 60 minutes, checking the bean\u2019s doneness every now and then. Note that the less time they have to soak, the longer they will take to cook.",
    "3. Remove the pot from the heat. Scoop out the onion, rosemary, bay leaf, garlic, and Parmesan rind (if using) and let cool before storing the beans in the fridge or freezer."
