  "directions": [
    "Slice the pork tenderloin crosswise into 4 equal pieces. Working with one piece at a time, place the pork, cut side down, on a cutting board and cover it loosely with plastic wrap. Use a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound the meat into a flat cutlet about \u00bd inch thick. Season the cutlets lightly on both sides with the salt.",
    "Set up a breading station with three shallow pans filled with the flour, egg, and panko. Lightly beat the egg. One at a time, coat each piece of pork with flour, dust off any excess, dip in egg, and then coat with panko, pressing gently to ensure a good coating. Transfer to a plate.",
    "Add the oil to a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat to 325\u00b0F. When a few pieces of panko sizzle on contact, the oil is ready. Fry the cutlets in batches for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack and let rest for a few minutes.",
    "Slice the pork into \u00bd-inch-wide strips and serve with steamed rice, shredded cabbage, lemon wedges, and a heavy drizzle of Bull-Dog sauce."
