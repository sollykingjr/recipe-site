    "1small head cauliflower (about 2 pounds/907 g), leaves removed, cored, and cut into bite-size florets",
    "1medium beet (about 6 ounces/170 g), scrubbed and sliced into paper-thin rounds on a mandoline",
    "1small red onion (about 5 ounces/142 g), thinly sliced on a mandoline",
    "3inches (8 cm) ginger, peeled and thinly sliced on a mandoline",
    "2tablespoons pink peppercorns, crushed",
    "1tablespoon black peppercorns",
    "1teaspoon coriander seeds",
    "21\u20444 cups (540 ml) unseasoned rice vinegar",
    "1cup (240 ml) water",
    "1\u20442 cup (168 g) honey",
    "3tablespoons kosher salt",
    "2dried bay leaves"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Place the cauliflower, beet, onion, and ginger in a large bowl, and toss to combine.2. Evenly divide the vegetables into two 1-quart (1 L) mason jars or similar airtight containers, pressing down as needed to fit snugly.3. Heat the pink peppercorns, black peppercorns, and coriander seeds in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Toast until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.4. Add the vinegar, water, honey, salt, and bay leaves, and increase the heat to medium. Heat just until the salt dissolves, about 5 minutes. The liquid doesn\u2019t have to come to a full boil.5. Pour the warm liquid evenly over the veggies in the jars, leaving about 1\u20442 inch (1 cm) headspace between the veggies and the lid. Let cool to room temperature and then cover and place in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. (After 24 hours, the pickles will be delicious and ready to eat, but the cauliflower won\u2019t be fully pink yet. After 2 or 3 days, the color will have fully developed.)6. Serve, or store in the refrigerator for up to 2 months."
