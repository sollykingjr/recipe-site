  "ingredients": [
    "- 1 (3- to 4-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken thigh, trimmed and cut into 1/4-inch pieces",
    "- 5 teaspoons plus 1/2 cup water, divided",
    "- 1 teaspoon plus 3 tablespoons cornstarch, divided",
    "- 1 teaspoon soy sauce",
    "- 1/8 teaspoon baking soda",
    "- 2 large eggs",
    "- 4 cups chicken broth, divided",
    "- 5\u20137 ears corn, kernels cut from cobs (5 cups), divided",

    "- 3/4 teaspoon table salt",
    "- 1/4 teaspoon white pepper",
    "- 1 scallion, sliced thin"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Combine chicken, 1 tablespoon water, 1 teaspoon cornstarch, soy sauce, and baking soda in bowl. In 2-cup liquid measuring cup, beat eggs and 2 teaspoons water with fork until thoroughly combined; set aside. Mix 1/2 cup broth and remaining 3 tablespoons cornstarch in small bowl until thoroughly combined; set aside.",
    "2. Process 2 1/2 cups corn and remaining 1/2 cup water in blender on low speed until thick puree forms, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to high; process until smooth, about 1 minute. Strain through fine-mesh strainer set over large saucepan, pressing with rubber spatula to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids.",
    "3. Add ham, salt, pepper, remaining 3 1/2 cups broth, and remaining 2 1/2 cups corn to corn puree. Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to maintain simmer and add chicken mixture, stirring to break up any clumps. Partially cover and simmer for 5 minutes (broth may look curdled as it comes to simmer). Stir broth-cornstarch mixture to recombine. Add to soup and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until soup has thickened slightly, about 2 minutes.",
    "4. Off heat, use 1 hand to stir soup with fork or chopsticks while using other hand to pour egg mixture in slow, steady stream into swirling soup. Continue stirring soup until cooked thin egg ribbons appear, about 1 minute. Season soup with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle individual portions with scallion before serving."
