  "ingredients": [
    "624g / 1 lb 6 oz extruded rigatoni",
    "585g / 2\u00bc cups diavola sauce",
    "22g / \u00bc cup finely grated pecorino romano",
    "3sprigs marjoram, leaves removed from stems",
    "14g / 1 Tbsp olive oil",
    "Black pepper, q.b."
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Generously salt the water.2. Add the rigatoni to the water and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, until al dente.3. While the pasta is cooking, place a large saut\u00e9 pan over low heat. Add the sauce and 1 ladle (55g / \u00bc cup) pasta cooking water and stir to combine.4. Using a spider or pasta basket, remove the pasta from the pot and transfer to the saut\u00e9 pan. Turn the heat up to medium. Toss for 1 to 2 minutes to marry the pasta and the sauce. If the sauce begins to tighten, add a splash of pasta cooking water to loosen and continue tossing to marry. When properly married, the pasta should absorb the sauce, glide easily when tossed, and there should be little sauce left at the bottom of the pan.5. Divide into bowls and garnish with the pecorino, marjoram, olive oil, and with pepper q.b."
