    "Cook the tomatillos, serranos, and onion directly on the grill until their skins have charred evenly, about 7 to 15 minutes. Turn every 3 to 4 minutes for even cooking. Remove to a plate.",
    "In a food processor, add the tomatillos, serranos, onion, garlic, cilantro, and salt. Pulse until a smooth paste forms, adding up to 2 tablespoons water to loosen the salsa as needed. Add the avocados and pulse again. Serve within 1 hour."
