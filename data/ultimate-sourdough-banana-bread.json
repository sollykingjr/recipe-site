  "ingredients": [
    "Butter, for coating the pan",
    "375g overripe bananas, weighed with the skin on (about 2 medium bananas)",
    "225g (1 1/4 cups lightly packed) light or dark brown sugar",
    "1\u00bdtsp pure vanilla extract",
    "2large eggs",
    "100g (appx. 1/2 cup) bubbly, active 100% hydration sourdough starter",
    "250g (2 cups) all-purpose flour",
    "1\u00bdtsp baking soda",
    "1/4tsp fine sea salt",
    "125ml (\u00bd cup) neutral flavored oil",
    "60ml (1/4 cup) milk",
    "Powdered sugar, butter, and mascarpone cheese for serving, optional"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 360 F.",
    "Lightly coat three 7x3x2 mini loaf pans or one 9\u00d75-inch loaf pan with butter.",
    "Add the bananas, sugar, and vanilla to a bowl. Cream with a hand held mixer or stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, about 30 seconds to 1 minute (some small lumps of banana are okay).",
    "Add the eggs, one at a time until fully incorporated. Add the sourdough starter.",
    "Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Working in batches, add this to the banana mixture.",
    "Add the milk and oil and mix until just combined. Do not over do it; the banana bread will be tough.",
    "Pour the batter into the prepared pan(s). If using the mini loaf pans, place them onto a baking sheet and transfer to the oven.",
    "Bake for 45 minutes (for the mini loaf pans) or 60- 65 minutes (for the standard 9\u00d75-inch pan), until rich golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean. Cover with foil if the loaf browns too quickly.",
    "Cool in the pan for 20 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
    "Serve with powdered sugar for a nice touch!"
