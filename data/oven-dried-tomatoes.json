  "ingredients": [
    "15 to 20plum or other small ripe tomatoes",
    "3tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "Kosher salt",
    "5fresh rosemary sprigs",
    "4fresh thyme sprigs"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Cut out the stem end of the tomatoes and halve them lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon.",
    "Toss the tomatoes with the oil (add a touch more, if necessary, to gloss them all nicely) and a generous sprinkle of salt. Arrange them cut-side up in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Scatter the rosemary and thyme sprigs over the tomatoes. Bake until the tomatoes look shriveled, especially around the edges, but are still quite moist; depending on your tomatoes, this could take between 2 and 3 hours.",
    "Remove from the oven and set aside until they\u2019re cool enough to handle. Try to peel them: If the skins come off easily, go ahead and remove them; if not, leave them on\u2014the tomatoes will still be good. If not using at once, transfer the tomatoes to an airtight container and cover with oil to prevent spoilage. Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks."
