    "10oz Brussels sprouts",
    "2cloves of garlic",
    "1oz shelled unsalted pistachios",
    "1pomegranate",
    "2heaping tablespoons cottage cheese"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Trim the sprouts, discard any tatty outer leaves, then cut in half. Place cut-side down in a single layer in a large dry non-stick frying pan on a high heat, and char for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic. Crush the pistachios in a pestle and mortar. Halve the pomegranate, squeeze the juice of one half through a sieve into a bowl, then hold the other half cut-side down in your fingers and bash the back of it with a spoon so all the seeds tumble out. Stir the sliced garlic into the sprouts with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a couple of splashes of water, then cook for 1 more minute.",
    "Divide the cottage cheese between your plates, spoon the gnarly sprouts on top, then sprinkle over the pomegranate seeds and pistachios. Drizzle over the pomegranate juice and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper from a height, and serve. Delicious."
