  "ingredients": [
    "4tablespoons (\u00bd stick) unsalted butter",
    "2tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling",
    "6garlic cloves, thinly sliced",
    "3cups fregola, Israeli couscous, ditalini, or other small pasta (about 1 pound)",
    "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "5\u20137cups water",
    "1cup finely grated pecorino or parmesan cheese, plus more for sprinkling",
    "2tablespoons finely chopped chives, for garnish",
    "4\u20136large egg yolks (optional)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Melt the butter and oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the fregola and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is well toasted, 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "2 Add 5 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook at a strong simmer, stirring frequently to encourage the releasing of the starch (almost like you\u2019re making a risotto) until the pasta is cooked through, the water is almost completely evaporated, leaving behind a creamy, starchy sauce, 20 to 25 minutes (add water as needed to keep it saucy while the pasta finishes cooking).",
    "3 Add the pecorino and season again with salt and lots of black pepper. Continue to cook until the pasta has the texture of risotto or a porridge, a few minutes or so (and add a splash of water if needed to keep things saucy).",
    "4 To serve, transfer the pasta mixture to a bowl and top with the chives and egg yolks, if using, plus more black pepper and more pecorino cheese. (Alternatively, spoon the creamy pasta into individual serving bowls and top each with an egg yolk, lots of pepper, and more pecorino.)"
