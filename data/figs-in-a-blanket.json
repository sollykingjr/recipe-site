  "ingredients": [
    "1tablespoon honey",
    "1tablespoon red wine vinegar",
    "Diamond Crystal kosher salt",
    "Freshly ground black pepper",
    "8small fresh figs",
    "2tablespoons pistachios, very finely chopped",
    "1tablespoon white sesame seeds",
    "Rye Pastry Dough (this page)",
    "1large egg, beaten"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 375\u00b0F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.",
    "2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the honey, vinegar, \u00bc teaspoon salt, and a few cracks of black pepper. Remove the tips from the figs, halve them lengthwise, and add them to the bowl. Toss to coat them in the vinegar and set aside.",
    "3. In a small bowl, stir together the pistachios and sesame seeds.",
    "4. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry dough into a 12-inch square. Cut the dough into four columns lengthwise and four columns crosswise, creating sixteen 3-inch squares of dough.",
    "5. Place one fig piece in the center of each dough square but don\u2019t discard the fig marinade. Fold up two opposite corners of the dough to pinch in the center, then fold up the bottom corner, encasing the fig and creating the \u201cfig in a blanket.\u201d Do this with all sixteen pieces and place them evenly spaced out on the lined sheet pan.",
    "6. Add the egg to the leftover fig marinade and whisk to create an egg wash. Brush each pastry with the egg wash and liberally sprinkle both the pastry and figs with the pistachio-sesame mixture.",
    "7. Bake until golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm."
