  "ingredients": [
    "Candied Peanuts",
    "1cup white sugar",
    "2cups unsalted roasted peanuts",
    "Flaky sea salt",
    "For Serving",
    "\u00bdcup sweetened coconut flakes",
    "1pint vanilla, coconut, or Jeni\u2019s Salted Peanut Butter ice cream",
    "4Nutter Butters, whacked into pieces",
    "Flaky sea salt"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "To candy the peanuts: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the sugar and \u00bc cup water in a medium skillet, give it a stir, and get it bubbling over medium-high heat. Cook, without stirring, until it turns golden brown in some spots, 4 to 5 minutes. Now start paying extra-close attention and keep cooking, swirling the pan frequently but still not stirring, until it turns an even bourbon color, about 1 minute more.",
    "Immediately turn off the heat, add the peanuts and a generous sprinkle of salt, and stir to coat well. Dump it all out onto the baking sheet in a single-ish layer to cool, breaking up any group hugs of polyamorous candied nuts. They\u2019ll keep at room temp in an airtight container for up to 1 week.",
    "To serve: Get your oven to 325\u00b0F.",
    "Spread the coconut flakes in an even layer on a small baking sheet and toast in the oven, stirring every 2 minutes or so, until they turn Winnie-the-Pooh brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Keep an eye out because they go from zero to brown real quick. Dump them in a bowl to cool.",
    "Scoop the ice cream in bowls (or just leave in the carton). Add the coconut flakes, Nutter Butters, and 1 cup of the peanuts, then finish with a sprinkle of salt. Eat."
