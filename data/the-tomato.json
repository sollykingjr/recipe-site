  "ingredients": [
    "6tablespoons unsalted butter, room-temp so it\u2019s mayo-soft",
    "8thick slices white bread, preferably 1 inch thick",
    "\u00bdcup mayo (Duke\u2019s or bust), or more if you like",
    "1cup roasted salted hulled sunflower seeds",
    "1tablespoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal or about half as much Morton)",
    "Freshly ground black pepper",
    "2pounds juicy, ripe tomatoes, cored and cut across into \u00bd-inch slices",
    "Big ol\u2019 handful of basil leaves",
    "Handful of picked dill",
    "2juicy lemons, halved"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Get a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet or griddle good and hot over medium heat. Swipe the butter on each side of the bread and toast in batches in the skillet until both sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. When they\u2019re done, move them to a rack or stand them up so they lean against each other to keep from getting soggy.",
    "Spread the mayo evenly on one side of each slice of bread, consider adding more because tomatoes love mayo, then sprinkle the sunflower seeds on four of the slices.",
    "Sprinkle the salt and lots of pepper on both sides of the tomato slices, then pile them on the bread slices that have sunflower seeds.",
    "Top the tomatoes with the herbs (it\u2019s a lot, so just try your best to tuck them in there and don\u2019t sweat it if they fall onto the plate).",
    "Squeeze on every last drop of juice from the lemons.",
    "Top with the rest of the bread. Cut it in half if you want. Instagram it, and tag your mom. Eat."
