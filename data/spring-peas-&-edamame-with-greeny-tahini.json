  "ingredients": [
    "2pounds sugar snap peas",
    "2cups shelled edamame",
    "1lemon",
    "8flat anchovy fillets, packed in oil",
    "2garlic cloves, grated",
    "\u00bdcup tahini",
    "\u00bdcup fresh parsley leaves",
    "Diamond Crystal kosher salt",
    "Extra-virgin olive oil",
    "\u2154cup Sourdough Bread Crumbs (this page)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Trim and clean the sugar snap peas, then slice them on a sharp diagonal into two or three pieces.",
    "2. In a bowl, combine the sugar snaps and edamame. Grate in about 1 teaspoon lemon zest. Halve the lemon and squeeze to get 3 tablespoons and set aside. (Set the lemon halves aside, too, for serving.)",
    "3. Set a small saut\u00e9 pan over medium-low heat and warm 1 teaspoon of the oil from the anchovy tin or jar. Drop in the anchovies and cook, stirring constantly, until they \u201cmelt\u201d into the oil, separating into anchovy paste. Add the garlic, increase the heat to medium, and cook for a minute or so until the garlic is no longer raw (but don\u2019t let it burn). Transfer this mixture to a blender and add the tahini, lemon juice, parsley, and \u00bd cup cool water. Blend for a few seconds, just long enough to get the parsley mostly combined but still with a few green flecks throughout. Taste and season with a pinch of salt, as needed.",
    "4. Place the same pan back over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and the bread crumbs. Toast for 3 to 4 minutes or until the bread crumbs are golden brown. Season with a pinch of salt and set aside.",
    "5. Pour a half cup of the dressing over the peas and edamame and mix together, adding more to taste. Divide among four bowls and top with a handful of bread crumbs. Grate in any lemon zest remaining on the reserved lemon halves."
