  "directions": [
    "Cut the cream cheese into \u00bc-inch cubes (see Note) and put it in the freezer while you start the batter.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, \u00bc cup of the butter, and vinegar. Stir the wet ingredients into the flour mixture. Let the batter sit around for 5 minutes, then stir in the cream cheese cubes.",
    "Heat a griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, brush the griddle with some of the remaining melted butter, and use a \u2153-cup measure to ladle the batter onto the griddle. Dot each pancake with 1 tablespoon of the blueberries and cook until tiny bubbles push up through the pancakes and the edges are lacy and brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until the underside is cooked and lacy, another 1 to 2 minutes. Continue cooking the pancakes, brushing the griddle with more melted butter between batches.",
    "Stack 2 or 3 pancakes on each plate, dot with butter, drizzle with syrup, and sprinkle with graham cracker crumbs and blueberries."
