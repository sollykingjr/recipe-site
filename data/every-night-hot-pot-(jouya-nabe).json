  "ingredients": [
    "One 5-inch square piece kombu or 4\u00bd cups Dashi",
    "1pound thinly sliced skinless pork belly (see Thinly Sliced Meat) or uncured bacon",
    "8ounces napa cabbage",
    "About 5 ounces (1 package) enoki mushrooms, trimmed"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Combine the kombu and 5 cups cold water in a large (3- to 5-quart) nabe, Dutch oven, or braiser and let the seaweed soak for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Or, if you have 4\u00bd cups dashi at the ready, skip ahead to step 2.",
    "2 Meanwhile, prep the meat and vegetables: Slice the pork belly or bacon into 3-inch-long pieces. Core the cabbage and cut it into 3-inch pieces. Break up the mushrooms into five or six smaller bundles.",
    "3 Bring the water and kombu, if using, to a gentle simmer over medium heat and cook for 10 minutes, then remove the kombu. (Or simply bring the dashi to a simmer.) Add the pork, cabbage, and mushrooms to the pot, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the cabbage and mushrooms are tender and the pork is cooked through.",
    "4 Serve family-style, with ponzu, soy sauce, and shichimi togarashi on the side. To eat, start with a splash of ponzu, then add some soy sauce and togarashi if you want it a little spicier and saltier. Steamed rice makes this a well-rounded meal."
