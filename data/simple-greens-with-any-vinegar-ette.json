    "PANTRY",
    "- 1\u00bd teaspoons Dijon mustard",
    "- \u00bd teaspoon honey, maple syrup, or sugar",
    "- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",

    "- \u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Do some prep:- If using whole heads of lettuce, separate the leaves and discard the knobby root ends. Submerge the lettuces in cold water and swoosh them around to release any grit. Drain and spin with a salad spinner until VERY dry.- Finely chop half of a shallot. Transfer to a large serving bowl.",
    "2. Make the dressing:- To the shallot, add 1\u00bd teaspoons Dijon mustard, \u00bd teaspoon honey, \u00bc teaspoon kosher salt, a few good cranks of black pepper, and 2 tablespoons vinegar, whisking to combine. Slowly drizzle in \u00bc cup olive oil, whisking constantly until the dressing is emulsified.- Taste and adjust the dressing if needed; it should taste zippy and zingy but also balanced with a touch of sweetness and some bite from the mustard and black pepper. Transfer half of the dressing to a small bowl, leaving the rest behind.",
    "3. Serve:- Add the lettuces and herbs to the bowl and use your hands to very gently fold to coat them with the dressing. Now you can add that remaining dressing as you see fit; maybe it needs just a smidge, maybe it needs all of it\u2014you decide. Season the salad with flaky sea salt and fold once more to disperse. Serve immediately."
