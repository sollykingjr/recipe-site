  "directions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Oil a roasting pan big enough to hold the chicken.2. Stuff the chicken with the onion quarters, lemon quarters, and rosemary sprigs. Sprinkle the dried herbs, salt, and pepper evenly over the chicken, top and bottom, and gently massage into the skin.3. Place the chicken in the pan and roast for about 50 minutes, then pour the orange juice and wine over the chicken. Continue roasting until the skin is crisp and nicely browned, the meat\u2019s juices run clear, and the pan juices are reduced and syrupy, 10 to 15 minutes more. If using a meat thermometer, the thickest part of the thigh should register 165\u00b0F (75\u00b0C).4. Remove the chicken from the oven and let rest for at least 10 minutes before carving it. Serve it with its pan juices."
