Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with 1 teaspoon salt and \u00bd teaspoon pepper.",
    "2. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in 12-inch ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place chicken skin side down in skillet, reduce heat to medium, and place heavy pot on chicken to press it flat. Cook chicken until skin is crisp and browned, about 25 minutes. (If chicken is not crisp after 20 minutes, increase heat to medium-high.)",
    "3. Off heat, remove pot and carefully flip chicken. Brush skin with za\u2019atar mixture, transfer skillet to oven, and roast until breast registers 160 degrees and thighs register 175 degrees, 10 to 20 minutes.",
    "4. Transfer chicken to carving board and let rest, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk mint, preserved lemon, vinegar, mustard, remaining \u215b teaspoon salt, and remaining \u215b teaspoon pepper in bowl until combined. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in remaining 3 tablespoons oil until emulsified. Carve chicken and serve with dressing."
