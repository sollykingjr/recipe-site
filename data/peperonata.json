  "ingredients": [
    "1large white onion",
    "4tablespoons olive oil",
    "a knob of butter",
    "4large or 6 medium red peppers (approximately 1\u00bc\u20131\u00bd pounds)",
    "about 1\u00bc pounds good, ripe tomatoes or canned peeled plum tomatoes",
    "salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1\u20132teaspoons red or white wine vinegar (optional)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Slice the onion. Heat the olive oil and butter in a pan and cook the onion gently until soft and lightly golden. Meanwhile, cut the peppers into strips, discarding the stems, seeds, and pith. Add the sliced peppers to the pan, stir, then cover the pan and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. Peel the tomatoes by plunging them into boiling water for 60 seconds, then transferring them to cold water, by which point the skins should split and slip off easily, then roughly chop them. If you are using canned plum tomatoes, chop them roughly directly in the can using scissors.",
    "After about 15 minutes, add the tomatoes, which will also relinquish their juices. Let the peperonata cook, uncovered, at a lively simmer for 30\u201340 minutes, reducing until almost all the liquid has evaporated and you are left with a thick, vivid stew that is slightly jammy. Season with salt, pepper, and a dash of vinegar to sharpen things up, if you like."
