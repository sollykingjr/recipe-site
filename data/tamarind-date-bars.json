  "ingredients": [
    "1cup / 140g all-purpose flour",
    "\u00bccup / 45g packed dark brown sugar",
    "Diamond Crystal kosher salt",
    "\u00becup / 200g almond butter",
    "3cups / 300g Medjool dates, pitted",
    "\u00bccup plus 1 tablespoon / 35g flaxseed meal",
    "1tablespoon maple syrup",
    "1tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons tamarind paste",
    "\u00bdteaspoon ground cardamom",
    "\u00bcteaspoon ground cloves",
    "\u00bdteaspoon ground cinnamon"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 350\u00b0F. Line a 9-inch round springform pan with parchment paper.",
    "2. In a food processor, combine the flour, brown sugar, \u00bc teaspoon salt, and the almond butter and pulse until a crumbly dough forms. Press this into the bottom of the lined springform pan.",
    "3. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until the crust has lightened by one shade in color.",
    "4. Meanwhile, wipe out the food processor and add the dates, \u00bc cup of the flaxseed meal, the maple syrup, tamarind paste, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Process until a thick, sticky filling forms that you can scoop like Play-Doh.",
    "5. Press the filling on top of the crust and evenly dust with the remaining 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal. Return to the oven and bake for another 10 minutes until the date mixture is firm and no longer sticky.",
    "6. Remove the pan from the oven and let it cool to room temperature. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be pretty tricky to slice. When the bars have cooled, release them from the pan and slice them into even pieces."
