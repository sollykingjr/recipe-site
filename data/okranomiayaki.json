  ],
  "ingredients": [
    "2pounds okra",
    "\u00bccup vegetable oil",
    "1tablespoon plus 1\u00bd teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal or about half as much Morton)",
    "\u00bccup plus 2 tablespoons okonomi sauce (I like the Otafuku brand)",
    "\u00bccup Kewpie mayo",
    "\u00bccup plus 2 tablespoons aonori (seaweed flakes)",
    "\u00bccup plus 2 tablespoons bonito flakes (katsuobushi)",
    "2tablespoons toasted sesame seeds",
    "2scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced (on the diagonal if you\u2019re feeling fancy)",
    "\u00bccup slivered beni shoga (Japanese red pickled ginger)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Get your oven to 375\u00b0F.",
    "Slice the okra lengthwise into about five slices (about \u215b inch thick each). There\u2019s no need to trim off the stems unless they\u2019re looking real gnarly.",
    "Toss the okra slices in a large mixing bowl with the oil and salt to coat them well. Scatter them onto two baking sheets in a single layer (some overlapping slices is no big deal) and roast, rotating the pan halfway through, until they turn beef-jerky brown at the edges but are still soft in the center, 30 to 40 minutes.",
    "Put the okra on a plate\u2014get in there with a thin spatula if your little okra babies decided to stick to the pan\u2014so there\u2019s not much empty space. Then evenly zigzag the okonomi sauce and mayo on top. Scatter with the aonori, bonito flakes, sesame seeds, and scallions. Serve with the ginger on the side."
