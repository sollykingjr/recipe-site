  "directions": [
    "Make the eggplant mixture: Set up a breading station in three wide bowls: In one bowl, beat the eggs. Spread the flour in a second bowl. Spread the bread crumbs in a third. Set the bowls in a row in this order: flour, eggs, bread crumbs. Dredge the eggplant slices, one at a time, dipping each slice first into the flour and shaking off the excess, then in the egg and allowing the excess to drip off, then pressing it into the bread crumb mixture to evenly coat both sides. Set aside on a baking sheet until ready to use.",
    "In a large saut\u00e9 pan, heat \u00bd cup of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches to avoid overcrowding, gently fry the eggplants in the oil, flipping once, until golden brown, about 30 seconds per side. Remove from the pan and set aside onto a plate lined with paper towels, seasoning lightly with salt while still hot. Repeat with the remaining eggplant, replenishing the pan with olive oil as needed. Continue stacking and seasoning the fried eggplant slices with a fresh paper towel in between the layers. Let cool completely.",
    "Once cool, finely dice the eggplant into \u00bc-inch pieces. Toss in a medium bowl with chopped basil, 1 teaspoon salt, the pecorino, tomato sauce, and oven-dried tomatoes (if using). Set aside.Assemble the rolls (see this page for step-by-step photos): In a large pot, bring 4 quarts water and 1 cup kosher salt to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, set up an ice bath in a large bowl. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.",
    "Working with one sheet at a time, place a pasta sheet in the boiling water for 15 seconds, then immediately remove and chill in the ice bath for 15 seconds. Transfer to the lined sheet pan and pat dry with a paper towel. Cover with another layer of parchment paper and repeat with the remaining pasta, creating a stack of sheets, each patted dry and each layer separated by parchment. Set aside.",
    "On a clean countertop, lay out one pasta sheet in front of you with a short side facing you (the sheet should look like a portrait shot). Spread \u00bc cup of the besciamella in a thin layer evenly across the sheet. Sprinkle 1 cup of mozzarella and \u00bc cup parmesan over the besciamella.",
    "Place another sheet of pasta on top. Spread 1 cup of the eggplant mixture evenly across the second pasta sheet, leaving a 2-inch border uncovered at the top short edge. Spoon 2 teaspoons of the besciamella onto the uncovered edge (this will act like your \u201cglue\u201d to seal the roll closed).",
    "Starting at the bottom edge, roll up the layered pasta into a thick log (like a jelly roll). Transfer to a small sheet pan seam-side down. Place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 and up to 2 hours, which will firm it up and make it easier to slice.",
    "Repeat the process with the remaining pasta sheets to make a total of 4 rolls, transferring to the refrigerator as you finish each roll. (The rolls can be tightly wrapped in plastic at this point and refrigerated for up to 2 days, or frozen for up to 3 months, before cooking. If frozen, thaw in the refrigerator before slicing.)",
    "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.",
    "Transfer the rolls to a cutting board. Using a serrated knife, slice each log in half crosswise, then slice each half in half to give you 4 slices per roll, each about 1\u00be inches thick.Ladle the tomato sauce into a 9 \u00d7 13-inch baking dish, covering the entire bottom of the dish. Arrange the lasagna pinwheels cut-side down in the baking dish, 4 pinwheels across in one direction and 4 across in the other. (It should fit all 16 pieces in one layer, gently staggered to fit.)",
    "Bake until the pasta edges are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven and add tablespoon-sized dollops of robiolina in between the pinwheels in a random pattern. Return to the oven and bake until the robiolina is warm and melted, an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Top with basil leaves and olive oil.",
    "Serve immediately. Leftovers keep, refrigerated, for up to 4 days."
