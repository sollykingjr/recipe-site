  "ingredients": [
    "1\u00bdcups / 210g all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading",
    "\u00bdteaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt",
    "1teaspoon baking powder",
    "\u00bdcup / 100g sour cream or Greek yogurt",
    "3tablespoons / 45g Your Perfect Herb Oil (this page), or any good olive oil",
    "\u00bcteaspoon flaky salt"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the sour cream with \u00bc cup / 60g water and mix into a shaggy dough. Transfer this dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 3 to 5 minutes to shape it into a smooth ball. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes.",
    "Position a rack in the top of the oven and preheat it to 400\u00b0F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.",
    "When the dough has rested, lightly dust it with flour again and use a rolling pin to roll it out into a long oval, 24 to 28 inches long and 8 to 9 inches wide. Roll this piece of dough onto your rolling pin and then transfer it to the lined sheet pan. When rolling it onto the sheet pan, let the bread drape every 2 inches in overlapping \u201cripples,\u201d creating a circle shape with many wrinkles.",
    "Brush the top of the bread with 2 tablespoons of the herb oil, making sure to get it in all the crevices and nooks.",
    "Bake until the edges of the bread are golden and crisp, 15 to 18 minutes. When it\u2019s out of the oven, brush it with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle on the flaky salt. Cut into triangular slices, like a pizza, and share."
