  "ingredients": [
    "1(16-ounce) block extra-firm tofu",
    "\u00bccup balsamic vinegar",
    "\u00bccup Worcestershire sauce",
    "\u00bccup soy sauce",
    "2tablespoons dark brown sugar",
    "3garlic cloves, grated",
    "1teaspoon grated fresh ginger",
    "Freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Cut the tofu crosswise into five even rectangular pieces and press using the method opposite.",
    "2. In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and \u00bc teaspoon pepper. Bring to a soft simmer, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce won\u2019t fully reduce, but it will still be pretty thin.",
    "3. Place the pressed tofu either in a large plastic bag or a storage container and pour the marinade over the tofu. Seal and let it sit in your fridge for 3 hours or up to 1 day. The longer it sits, the more the marinade it will absorb. If the marinade doesn\u2019t completely cover the tofu, flip it about halfway through the marinating time.",
    "4. When you\u2019re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.",
    "5. Take the tofu out of the marinade but reserve the marinade. Arrange the tofu on the lined sheet pan and bake until it\u2019s firm and sliceable, 45 to 50 minutes. To use it throughout the week, store it in the fridge in an airtight container with \u00bc cup of the leftover marinade. It will keep for slicing and serving for 1 week."
