  "directions": [
    "1. For the sauce: Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat; add shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add beef and chicken broths, increase heat to high, and boil until reduced to about \u00bd cup, about 8 minutes. Set aside reduced broth mixture.",
    "2. For the steaks: Meanwhile, pat steaks dry with paper towels and sprinkle both sides with salt; rub 1 side of each steak with crushed peppercorns and, using your fingers, press peppercorns into steaks to make them adhere.",
    "3. Heat oil in a clean, dry skillet over medium heat until hot, about 4 minutes. Add steaks, unpeppered side down, and increase heat to medium-high. Firmly press on steaks with the bottom of a cake pan or flat pot lid, remove pan, and cook steaks without moving them until well browned on the first side, about 6 minutes. Flip steaks. Firmly press down on steaks with the bottom of a cake pan or flat pot lid, remove pan, and cook on peppered side until meat registers 115 to 120 degrees (for rare), 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare), or 130 to 135 degrees (for medium), about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer steaks to a plate and tent with aluminum foil.",
    "4. Pour \u00bc cup brandy, cream, and reduced broth mixture into now-empty skillet; increase heat to high and bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits. Simmer until deep golden brown and thick enough to heavily coat the back of a metal tablespoon or soupspoon, about 5 minutes. Off heat, whisk in lemon juice, remaining 3 tablespoons butter, remaining 1 tablespoon brandy, and any accumulated steak juices. Season with salt to taste. Set steaks on individual plates, spoon portion of sauce over steaks, and serve immediately."
