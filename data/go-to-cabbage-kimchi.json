  "directions": [

    "2. Tear each half into quarters lengthwise by hand. Place the cabbage in a large bowl.",

    "4. Drain well and return the cabbage to the bowl.",
    "5. In a small saucepan, whisk the rice flour and 2 cups water over high heat until boiling. Add the sugar, stir, and transfer to a heatproof bowl to cool.",
    "6. Once cooled, blend the rice mixture with onion, ginger, and garlic until smooth. Transfer to a mixing bowl.",
    "7. Add gochugaru, mushroom seasoning, sambal, vinegar, scallions, and \u00bc cup water. Stir well.",

    "9. Transfer the cabbage to a wide-mouth 2-quart glass jar and pour in any remaining chili mixture.",
    "10. Press down with a spoon so the liquid rises to (or nearly) cover the vegetables.",
