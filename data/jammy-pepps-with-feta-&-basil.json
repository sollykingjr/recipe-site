    "1. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F.",
    "2. Prep the veg:- Remove the cores of 3\u00bd pounds bell peppers by cutting off 4 lobes on each, leaving behind the cores, stems, and seeds. Cut each lobe into roughly 1\u00bd-inch-thick strips.- Thinly slice 1 Fresno chile crosswise.- Firmly smash and peel 8 garlic cloves.",
    "3. Cook the peppers:- Heat \u00bd cup olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.- Add the bell peppers, Fresno chile, garlic, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Stir and toss to combine. Cook until some of the peppers begin to soften and turn golden brown in spots, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in \u00bc cup red wine vinegar.- Partially cover the pot and transfer it to the oven. Cook, stirring a couple of times throughout, until the peppers are very soft and jammy, 45 to 60 minutes.- Remove the lid and cook until the peppers have caramelized and the liquid has reduced slightly, 30 to 45 minutes longer. Let cool slightly, then taste and adjust with more vinegar, salt, or sugar as needed.",
