  "ingredients": [
    "5\u00bcounces guanciale, pancetta, or bacon",
    "a little olive oil",
    "salt",
    "1pound spaghetti",
    "2whole eggs and 2 extra yolks",
    "\u00becup grated pecorino or Parmesan, or a mixture of both",
    "freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Cut the guanciale into short, thick strips. In a large frying pan over medium heat, cook the guanciale in a little olive oil until the fat has rendered and the pieces are golden and crisp. Remove from the heat.",
    "Add salt to the boiling water, stir, then add the spaghetti, fanning it out and using a wooden spoon to gently press and submerge the strands. Cover the pot until the water comes back to a boil, then remove the lid and continue cooking until it is al dente (check the cooking time on the package and start tasting at least 2 minutes earlier).",
    "While the pasta is cooking, in a largish bowl whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, grated cheese, a pinch of salt, and plenty of black pepper. Heat up the meat pan again, and once hot, use a slotted spoon to transfer three-quarters of the guanciale pieces to a small plate, leaving the last quarter and the fat in the pan.",
    "Drain the pasta, reserving a cup of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the frying pan, stirring so that each strand is coated with fat. Turn off the heat, then add the egg and cheese mixture and a little cooking water. Using a wooden spoon or fork, mix everything together vigorously so each strand is coated with a creamy sauce. Add just a little more cooking water if the sauce is too stiff. Serve immediately, dividing the rest of the crisp guanciale between the plates."
