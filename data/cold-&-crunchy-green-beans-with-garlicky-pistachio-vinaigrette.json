    "3. Cook the beans:- Once the water boils, stir in the beans and cook until just tender but not limp, 5 to 6 minutes.- While the beans cook, fill a large bowl with ice and water. Using a spider strainer or tongs, transfer the cooked beans to the ice bath to stop the cooking. Keep them in the ice bath until completely cool.",
    "4. Make the dressing:- Finely grate 1 garlic clove and the zest of 1 lemon into a medium bowl. Cut the zested lemon and a second lemon in half and add the juice from both lemons to the bowl, whisking it all to combine.- Slowly stream in \u2153 cup olive oil, whisking as you go. Stir in 1\u00bd ounces grated Parmesan cheese (about \u2153 cup). Season the dressing with salt and lots of black pepper. Stir in the chopped pistachios.",
    "5. Drain and assemble:- Drain the beans, then transfer them to a clean kitchen towel and pat dry.- Add the green beans to the bowl of dressing, tossing well to coat. Taste and add more salt and black pepper if you think it needs it. Serve them up! These are best served very cold, so keep them covered and refrigerated until serving if you\u2019re making them in advance."
