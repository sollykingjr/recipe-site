  "ingredients": [
    "1tablespoon Chinese five-spice powder",
    "1full rack St. Louis-style spareribs, cut into individual ribs (about 3 pounds total)",
    "1/2cup hoisin sauce",
    "1/4cup shaoxing wine or dry sherry",
    "2tablespoons soy sauce",
    "1/4cup honey"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Sprinkle five-spice powder evenly over ribs and rub into them until thoroughly and evenly coated. Set ribs aside.",
    "2. Combine hoisin sauce, shaoxing wine, soy sauce, and honey in a gallon-sized zipper lock bag. Add ribs to bag and mix until evenly coated. Seal bag, transfer to refrigerator, and let ribs marinate at least overnight and up to three nights.",
    "3. When ready to cook, preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Remove ribs from bag, wiping off excess marinade with your fingers (reserve the marinade). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, set a wire rack in it, and spread the ribs evenly over the rack. Cover with aluminum foil and roast for 1 hour. Remove foil, brush ribs with marinade, increase heat to 450\u00b0F, and continue to roast until charred, glazed, and sticky, about 20 minutes longer, rotating ribs and basting with marinade once more during cooking. Let rest 10 minutes, then serve."
