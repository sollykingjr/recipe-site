    "2. Melt the butter and chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.",
    "3. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the whole eggs, yolks, and the sugar on medium-high speed until light and thick. Add the melted chocolate mixture and beat to combine. Mix in the 1 tablespoon flour until just combined. Transfer to a large bowl.",
    "4. Wash and dry the mixing bowl, add the egg whites, and whip on medium speed until soft peaks form. Fold the whites into the chocolate mixture. Fill each ramekin halfway with the batter. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the dulce de leche in the center and then top with the remaining batter.",
    "5. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet, and bake until the sides have set but the centers remain soft, 6 to 7 minutes.",
