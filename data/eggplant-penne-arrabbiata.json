  "ingredients": [
    "12fresh mixed-color chilies",
    "2eggplants (1 lb total)",
    "10oz dried whole-wheat penne",
    "4cloves of garlic",
    "1x 14-oz can of plum tomatoes"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "To make a quick chili oil, halve and seed the chilies. Fill a clean heatproof jar with olive oil, then pour it into a non-stick frying pan on a medium-low heat and add the chilies to confit. Meanwhile, put a pan of boiling salted water on for the pasta. Halve the eggplants lengthways and blanch in the water, covered, for 5 minutes, then lift out, leaving the water to boil. Carefully scoop the soft chilies into the jar, then spoon in the oil, leaving 2 tablespoons in the pan (keep the jar of chili oil to add a kick to future meals). Chop the eggplant into 1\u00bc-inch chunks, add to the pan with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then turn the heat up to high, stirring regularly.",
    "Cook the pasta according to the package instructions while you peel and finely slice the garlic, then fry with the eggplant for 2 minutes. Pour in the tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, and half a can\u2019s worth of water. Add as many of the chilies as you dare to the sauce and simmer until the pasta is ready, then taste and season to perfection. Drain the pasta, reserving a cupful of cooking water, then toss the pasta through the sauce, loosening with a little reserved cooking water, if needed. Dish up."
