  "directions": [
    "1. Rinse potatoes in a bowl under cold running water until water turns clear. Cover with cold water and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 12 hours.",
    "2. Pour off water, spread potatoes on dish towels, and dry thoroughly. Transfer potatoes to a dry bowl and toss with cornstarch until evenly coated. Transfer potatoes to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and let rest until a fine white coating forms, about 20 minutes.",
    "3. Meanwhile, add peanut oil to a large Dutch oven until it measures about 2 inches deep and heat over medium heat to 325 degrees. Line a second baking sheet with a triple layer of paper towels.",
    "4. Transfer half of potatoes, 1 handful at a time, to hot oil and increase heat to high. Fry, stirring with a spider skimmer or slotted spoon, until potatoes start to turn from white to blond, 4 to 5 minutes. (Oil temperature will drop about 75 degrees during this frying.) Transfer fries to the prepared sheet. Return oil to 325 degrees and repeat with remaining potatoes. Reduce heat to medium and let fries cool while cooking steaks, at least 10 minutes. (Recipe can be prepared through step 4 up to 2 hours in advance; turn off heat under peanut oil, turning heat back to medium when you start step 5.)",
    "5. Pat steaks dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat vegetable oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add steaks and cook, without moving them, until well browned on the first side, about 4 minutes. Flip steaks and cook, without moving, until well browned on the second side and meat registers 115 to 120 degrees (for rare) or 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare), 3 to 7 minutes. Transfer steaks to a plate, top with herb butter, and tent with aluminum foil.",
    "6. Increase heat under pot to high and heat oil to 375 degrees. Add half of fries, 1 handful at a time, and fry until golden brown and puffed, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the sheet lined with clean paper towels. Return oil to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining fries. Season fries with salt to taste and serve with steak."
