  "directions": [
    "make the crispy shallots In your smallest skillet, heat \u00bd inch of oil over medium heat. (I use 8 to 10 tablespoons in my 6-inch skillet.) Add the shallots to the skillet, breaking the rings up a little as you drop them in. Cook, stirring, until the shallots are a good golden brown, then transfer them with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with several paper towels and sprinkle them with salt. The shallots will keep cooking a little after they leave the skillet, so removing them just a bit early is recommended.",
    "make the dressing Whisk together the dressing ingredients.",
    "for the salad Cook the green beans in a pot of salted water until crisp and just barely tender, about 3 minutes. Drain, and plunge them into ice water to stop them from cooking and to cool. If you\u2019ve got better things to do than draw a bath of ice water, you could remove the beans at 2 minutes; they\u2019ll continue cooking as they cool. Drain and pat dry.",
    "Remove any small children from the kitchen. Over a hot grill or an open gas-stove flame, char the ears of corn until most of the kernels are blackened, turning with tongs to get at all sides. The corn has a tendency to crackle and splatter, so wear oven mitts and be cautious. When the corn is cool enough to handle, shave off the kernels with a large knife, and reserve.",
    "In a large skillet, heat the neutral oil over medium heat. Add the shallots, garlic, and chile, and cook for 1 minute, until just softened. Add the corn, season with salt, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, just to soften the corn. Turn off the heat, quickly stir in the green beans and tomatoes, and pour half the dressing over the top. Pile on a plate, and garnish with basil and crispy shallots. Serve with the remaining dressing on the side."
