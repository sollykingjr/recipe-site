  "ingredients": [
    "Crust:",
    "- 1 1/2 cups (7 1/2 ounces) all-purpose flour",
    "- 1 tablespoon sugar",
    "- 1/2 teaspoon table salt",
    "- 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces and chilled",
    "- 6 tablespoons ice water",
    "Custard:",
    "- 1 cup warm water (110 degrees)",
    "- 1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) sugar",
    "- 2 large eggs plus 2 large yolks",
    "- 1/2 cup evaporated milk",
    "- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
    "- 1/8 teaspoon table salt"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. For the crust: Process flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor until combined, about 5 seconds. Scatter butter over top and pulse until butter pieces are the size of small peas, about 10 pulses. Continue to pulse, slowly streaming in ice water, until dough begins to form small curds that hold together when pinched with fingers, about 10 pulses.",
    "2. Transfer mixture to a lightly floured counter and gather into a rectangular-shaped pile. Starting at the farthest end, use the heel of a lightly floured hand to smear a small amount of dough against the counter. Continue to smear dough until all crumbs have been worked. Gather smeared crumbs together in another rectangular-shaped pile and repeat the process. Form dough into a 5-inch square, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.",
    "3. Evenly space twelve 3-inch metal tart pans on a parchment paper\u00e2\u20ac\u201clined rimmed baking sheet and spray with vegetable oil spray; set aside. Divide dough in half. Working with 1 half of dough at a time, roll into a 12 by 8-inch rectangle on a lightly floured counter. Using a 4-inch round dough cutter, cut out 6 dough rounds. Working with 1 round at a time, center it in the prepared tart pan and use fingers to press dough evenly into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Trim any overhang 1/4 inch beyond the lip of the pan. Repeat with the remaining 5 dough rounds and then repeat rolling and shaping 6 more rounds with the remaining dough half. Lightly prick shells all over with a fork, cover loosely with plastic, and refrigerate until dough is firm, about 15 minutes.",
    "4. For the custard: Adjust oven rack to the lowest position and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Whisk water and sugar in a bowl until sugar has dissolved. Let cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. Whisk eggs and yolks, evaporated milk, vanilla, and salt together in a separate large bowl. Whisk sugar-water mixture into the egg mixture until combined. Strain the egg mixture through a fine-mesh strainer set over a 4-cup liquid measuring cup or bowl.",
    "5. Divide custard evenly among pastry shells, leaving 1/4-inch space below the rim of each tart pan. (You may have extra filling.) Using a fork or toothpick, pop any large bubbles on the surface of the custard. Carefully transfer the sheet to the oven and bake until shells are golden brown and crisp and edges of custard are just set and the center of custard jiggles slightly when gently shaken, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the sheet halfway through baking. Let tarts cool in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Gently unmold tarts and let cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature."
