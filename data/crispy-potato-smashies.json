  "ingredients": [
    "1\u00bdpounds baby potatoes (the smallest you can find: 16 to 24 potatoes)",
    "\u00bccup olive oil",
    "1\u00bdteaspoons kosher salt",
    "1teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste",
    "2tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. (If using an electric oven, see Note.)",
    "Put the potatoes in a large microwave-safe bowl and fill the bottom with \u00bd inch of water. Cover with plastic wrap and poke the wrap a few times with a fork. Microwave on high until the potatoes can be easily pierced with a fork, somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes (check after 10 minutes; if they\u2019re still hard, return them for another 5, and so on, replenishing the water, if necessary). Remove, uncover, drain well, and cool until just warm.",
    "Using the heel of your hand, smash the potatoes into rounds. (You want them to hold together, so be gentle. Love your potatoes, even when you\u2019re smashing them in the face.)",
    "Pour the oil onto a large rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle the oil with \u00be teaspoon of the salt and \u00bd teaspoon of the pepper. Arrange the smashies on the sheet and sprinkle the tops with the remaining \u00be teaspoon salt and \u00bd teaspoon pepper. Put it on the floor of the oven (yep) and roast until the undersides are crispy but not burnt, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and use tongs or a spatula to flip the potatoes, then return to the oven and roast until the undersides are crispy, another 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, transfer to a serving platter, and garnish with the parsley."
