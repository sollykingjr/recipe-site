    "Place the warm water in the bottom of a medium bowl. Sprinkle the yeast over the top, and let it dissolve for 10 minutes. Stir in the olive oil and yogurt, then 2 cups flour and all the salt plus flavorings of choice (except za\u2019atar, which is best at the end). Combine with a wooden spoon until everything is incorporated. Add \u00bd cup flour, and stir it in\u2014the dough will be getting stiff, so flex those guns\u2014and then the remaining 2 tablespoons. Bash it around in the bowl, then scrape it onto the counter while you roll 1 tablespoon olive oil around in the bowl. Return the dough immediately to the bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and set it aside until it has about doubled in size, 60 to 70 minutes.",
    "Flip the dough out onto a floured counter, and divide it into quarters (or more pieces, for smaller breads). Flour a baking tray. Roughly stretch each dough piece flat on the tray with your equally floured fingers. Repeat with the remaining pieces. Brush the bread tops with olive oil.",
    "Heat your outdoor grill or a stove top grill pan to medium-high. Once it\u2019s hot, place the dough, oiled side down, on it and grill until dark grill marks appear underneath, about 5 minutes. Brush the tops of flatbreads with more oil, then flip the breads over and cook until the second side is dark, too.",
