  "directions": [
    "1. Make the bean spread: Add the beans, anchovies, lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic to a blender, and blend on high until very smooth. Season with salt and pepper.2. Make the salad: Place the little gem leaves in a large ice bath. Let sit for a few minutes to crisp the lettuce. Remove from the ice bath and dry in a salad spinner, or lay out on a kitchen towel to dry completely. You don\u2019t want a watery salad!3. Add the little gem, cilantro, parsley, dill, mint, and chives to a large bowl.4. Dress the salad to taste with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. I like to have a deft hand with the lemon here.5. Spread the white bean puree on the bottom of a large platter, and mound the little gem high on top.6. Top generously with Parmesan and more chives, and serve."
