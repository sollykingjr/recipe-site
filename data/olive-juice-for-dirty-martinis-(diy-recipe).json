  "ingredients": [
    "2cups green olives",
    "2\u00c2\u00bdcups water",
    "2tablespoons vinegar",
    "2tablespoons salt"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Put the olives in the glass jar, and press them well with the wooden spoon to release their natural juices.",
    "Mix the water, vinegar, and salt, and pour the mixture over the olives. Be sure the mixture covers the olives, but leave some airspace at the top of the jar.",
    "Seal the container tightly with the lid, and shake it vigorously. This action blends the mixture and allows the olives to release a little more flavor.",
    "Refrigerate the jar, and be sure to shake it again before using the juice. The longer the mixture is allowed to sit, the stronger the olive brine becomes.",
    "Repeat this process until you've finished your olives, and you'll never have to waste them again.",
    "Tip for Maximizing the Juice in the Jar",
    "If you still prefer the brine you get when you purchase a container of olives, try purchasing your olives from a gourmet food store where you can scoop them into a container yourself. Add extra olive brine so that you can use some to make martinis, yet still have enough left over to cover the olives. When your olive juice starts to get low, add vermouth, which is similar in taste."
