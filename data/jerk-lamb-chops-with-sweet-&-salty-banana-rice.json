  "directions": [
    "MAKE THE LAMB CHOPS In a large bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the jerk seasoning, the Pickapeppa, and garlic. Add the lamb chops, and smush around to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 8 hours.",
    "Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat until very hot.",
    "Remove the chops from the marinade, pat dry with paper towels, and sprinkle all over with the remaining 2 tablespoons jerk seasoning and the salt. Grill the chops until nicely seared, 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and cook until medium-rare, another 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "MAKE THE BANANA RICE In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Toss the bananas with the sugar and saut\u00e9 until slightly caramelized, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice and \u00bd teaspoon of the salt and cook, stirring occasionally (but don\u2019t mash up the bananas too much), until very hot, about 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining \u00bd teaspoon salt, then add more salt until it tastes like a good balance between sweet and salty.",
    "Garnish the lamb with thyme and serve with lime wedges and the rice."
