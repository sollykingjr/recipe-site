  "ingredients": [
    "- 8 scallions, trimmed and very roughly chopped",
    "- \u00bc pound unpeeled ginger, washed well and roughly chopped",
    "- 1\u00bd cups olive or canola oil",
    "- 1 tablespoon Mushroom Seasoning Powder, homemade or store-bought",
    "- Scant 1 teaspoon granulated sugar"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "PULSE the scallions in a food processor just until finely chopped. Scrape into a large heatproof mixing bowl (large, because when you add hot oil it\u2019ll bubble up). Pulse the ginger in the food processor just until finely chopped, and add it to the bowl, too. Stir well.",
    "HEAT the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until it\u2019s very hot but not quite smoking, then pour it over the scallion-ginger mixture. Let it cool for a couple minutes, then stir in the mushroom seasoning powder and sugar and let it cool completely.",
    "IT keeps in the fridge for up to 1 month. Stir well before using."
