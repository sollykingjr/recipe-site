    "Cook the noodles in boiling salted water according to the package instructions, then drain, reserving a cupful of cooking water. Meanwhile, finely grate the zest of 1 lime, snip the cress, and put both aside. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry non-stick frying pan on a high heat for 1 minute, tossing regularly. Reserving one-quarter of the seeds, pound the rest in a pestle and mortar until fairly fine, then muddle in the teriyaki and the juice of 1 lime. Taste, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, and you\u2019ve got a black tahini!",
