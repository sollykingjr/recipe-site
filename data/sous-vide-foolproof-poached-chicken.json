    "1. Using sous vide circulator, bring water to 150 degrees in 7-quart container.",
    "2. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Place chicken and oil in 1-gallon zipper-lock freezer bag and toss to coat. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Gently lower bag into prepared water bath until chicken is fully submerged, and then clip top corner of bag to side of water bath container, allowing remaining air bubbles to rise to top of bag. Reopen 1 corner of zipper, release remaining air bubbles, and reseal bag. Cover and cook for at least 1 hour or up to 3 hours. (Chicken can be rapidly chilled in ice bath [see this page] and then refrigerated in zipper-lock bag after step 2 for up to 5 days. To reheat, return sealed bag to water bath set to 150 degrees for 20 minutes and then proceed with step 3.)",
    "3. Transfer chicken to paper towel\u2013lined plate and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve."
