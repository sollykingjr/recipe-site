  "directions": [
    "Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. In a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Brown the chicken all at once (it\u2019s OK if they don\u2019t all lie flat in the pot; we\u2019re saving time here) until golden, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a plate.",
    "Add the onion to the pot and cook, stirring, until just softened, about 4 minutes. Add the ginger, garlic, and curry paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the coconut milk, brown sugar, and fish sauce until smooth. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer about 2 minutes. Stir in the bell peppers and potato, then return the chicken with any juices to the pot. Cover and simmer until the chicken and potatoes are just cooked through, about 20 minutes.",
    "While the curry is cooking, place the broccoli and \u00bd inch of water in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover and microwave on high until the broccoli turns bright green, about 3 minutes. Drain.",
    "Uncover the curry and stir in the broccoli, \u00bd teaspoon salt (or more to taste), white pepper, and jalape\u00f1o and simmer, uncovered, until the liquid thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Serve with rice and garnish with basil and more jalape\u00f1o."
