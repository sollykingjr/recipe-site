  "ingredients": [
    "1batch egg dough (this page)",
    "85g / 6 Tbsp unsalted butter, cold and cubed",
    "68g / \u00be cup finely grated parmigiano-reggiano",
    "White truffle, q.b."
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 - Following the instructions for tajarin on this page, make 624g / 1 lb 6 oz with the pasta dough.",
    "2 - Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Generously salt the water.",
    "3 - Heat a large saut\u00e9 pan over low heat. Add the butter and about 2 ladles (115g / \u00bd cup) pasta cooking water. Swirl the contents of the pan to emulsify. Set aside off the heat.",
    "4 - Add the tajarin to the water and cook for 15 to 20 seconds. Tajarin is quite delicate and will cook very quickly.",
    "5 - Return the reserved saut\u00e9 pan to low heat. Using tongs or a pasta basket, remove the pasta from the pot and transfer to the saut\u00e9 pan. Turn the heat up to medium. Toss for 30 seconds to 1 minute to marry the pasta and the sauce. If the sauce begins to tighten, add a splash of pasta cooking water and continue to marry. When the pasta is properly married, it will cling to the sauce and have a glossy sheen.",
    "6 - Remove the pan from the heat and sprinkle in 45g / \u00bd cup of the parmigiano while tossing to incorporate.",
    "7 - Divide the pasta into bowls and garnish with the remaining parmigiano. Shave truffle over each serving q.b."
