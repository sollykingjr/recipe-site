Allow the dough to rest for 5 minutes and then knead it until smooth. Divide the dough into 8 pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Place the balls in a well-floured bowl and cover them with a kitchen towel to rest for about 30 minutes before shaping the tortillas.",

    "Preheat a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, place a tortilla on the pan and cook it for 30 to 45 seconds, or until small bubbles start to form. Flip it over with your hands or a spatula and cook for another 30 to 45 seconds. Remove from the pan and place it in a tortilla warmer or wrap in a kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining dough. Serve immediately."
