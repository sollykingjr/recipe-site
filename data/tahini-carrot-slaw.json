  "ingredients": [
    "2heaping tablespoons mixed raw seeds",
    "\u00bda clove of garlic",
    "1lemon",
    "10oz mixed-color carrots",
    "2crunchy eating apples"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Toast the seeds in a dry non-stick frying pan on a medium heat until lightly golden, tossing regularly, then remove. Put three-quarters of the seeds into a pestle and mortar with a pinch of sea salt, and pound until fairly fine. Peel and add the garlic, then smash to a paste. Squeeze in the lemon juice, then muddle in 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and a tiny dribble of red wine vinegar to make a delicious tahini-style dressing.",
    "Wash the carrots, then finely slice into matchsticks with good knife skills or using the julienne cutter on a mandolin (use the guard!). Core and slice the apples the same way, then toss both with the tahini dressing. Taste, season to perfection with salt and black pepper, then scatter over the remaining seeds."
