  "directions": [
    "1. Place peppercorns, star anise, and bay leaf in center of small piece of cheesecloth; gather edges of cheesecloth and tie with kitchen twine to form sachet. Cook pork in 14-inch flat-bottomed wok over medium heat, stirring frequently, until fat begins to render and pork begins to brown, about 7 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to plate.",
    "2. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from wok. (Add vegetable oil as needed to equal 1 tablespoon.) Add rock sugar to fat left in wok and cook, stirring frequently, until sugar has melted and mixture is amber-colored, about 1 minute. Stir in garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in michiu, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in pork and any accumulated juices, 2 cups water, shallots, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, pepper, and spice sachet and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer gently for 2 hours.",
    "3. Meanwhile, bring 1 inch water to rolling boil in large saucepan over high heat. Place eggs in collapsible steamer basket. Transfer basket to saucepan. Cover, reduce heat to medium (small wisps of steam should escape from beneath lid), and cook for 8 minutes. When eggs are almost finished cooking, fill large bowl halfway with ice and water. Using tongs or slotted spoon, transfer eggs to ice bath. Discard water in saucepan. Let eggs sit for 15 minutes. Peel eggs and transfer to medium bowl; set aside.",
    "4. Nestle eggs into sauce and cook, covered, until pork is very tender and eggs are deep brown, 30 minutes to 1 hour, turning eggs halfway through cooking.",
    "5. Discard spice sachet and transfer eggs to cutting board. Bring pork mixture to boil over high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until sauce thickens and begins to coat back of spoon, about 3 minutes. Divide rice among serving bowls and spoon sauce over top. Halve eggs and arrange on top of each bowl with pickled mustard greens and extra fried shallots. Serve."
