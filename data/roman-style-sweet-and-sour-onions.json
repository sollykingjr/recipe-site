    "Peel the onions and soak them in cold water for 4 hours, then drain them. Chop two of them very finely along with the garlic and cook them gently in the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed frying pan.",
    "Once the chopped onion and garlic are soft, golden, and translucent, add the rest of the whole onions, stirring so that they are all well coated with oil. Sprinkle with salt and sugar, then almost cover them with a mixture of half water and half vinegar\u2014the amount will depend on the size of your pan.",
    "Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Half cover the pan and leave it to bubble gently for about 2 hours, turning the onions every now and then. They\u2019re ready when all the liquid has evaporated and the onions are very soft, sitting in dark, shiny, sticky sauce."
