  "ingredients": [
    "about 1\u00bc pounds russet potatoes, ideally 3 or 4 equal-size ones",
    "1egg",
    "scant 2\u00bd cups Italian 00 flour or King Arthur Italian-style flour (you may not need all of it)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Scrub, but don\u2019t peel, the potatoes. In a large pan, cover the potatoes with cold water, bring to a boil, and cook until they\u2019re tender to the point of a knife. Drain and then return them briefly to the pan over very low heat for about 30 seconds so that they dry out.",
    "Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel them, and while they are still warm, pass them through a potato ricer or food mill into a heap on a work surface. Make a crater in the center of the pile, break the egg into the crater, and then, using your fingertips, work the egg into the potato. A wonderfully sticky job.",
    "Sift the flour into a bowl and then tip half of it over the potato-and-egg mixture. Work the flour into the mixture with your fingertips, adding more flour and working until you have a consistent, soft dough that comes away from your hands and the board. The amount of flour you need will vary.",
    "Divide the dough into 6 pieces and, on a lightly floured board, roll each piece into a slim log about \u00be inch wide. Cut the log into pieces as wide as they are thick, then gently press each piece with the back of a fork to give it the ridges that will later collect sauce. Cover the gnocchi with a clean tea towel until you\u2019re ready to cook them."
