Fluff bulgur gently with fork, discard dill and garlic, and cover to keep warm.",
    "2. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and sprinkle with \u00bd teaspoon salt and \u00bc teaspoon pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch ovensafe skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook chicken skin side down until well browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip chicken, transfer skillet to oven, and roast until breasts register 160 degrees and drumsticks/thighs register 175 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes.",
    "3. Meanwhile, whisk lemon zest and juice, remaining \u00bc teaspoon salt, remaining \u00bc teaspoon pepper, and remaining 2 tablespoons oil together in large bowl. Add bulgur, cucumber, red peppers, and minced dill and toss gently to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "4. Transfer chicken to serving platter, reserving pan juices in skillet. In small bowl, whisk harissa together with 2 to 4 tablespoons pan juices, 1 tablespoon at a time, until mixture is loose and spreadable. Brush mixture onto chicken, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Season yogurt with salt and pepper to taste. Serve chicken with bulgur salad and seasoned yogurt."
