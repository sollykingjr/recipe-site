    "8scallions",
    "1\u20132fresh mixed-color chilies",

  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Put a non-stick ovenproof frying pan on a high heat. Pull off the chicken skin, put both skin and legs into the pan, season with sea salt and black pepper, and let the fat render out and the chicken get golden for 5 minutes, turning halfway, while you trim the scallions and halve across the middle, putting the green halves aside. Toss the white scallions into the pan, then transfer to the oven for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, seed the chilies, then finely slice lengthways with the green scallions and pop both into a bowl of ice-cold water to curl and crisp up. Peel the oranges, finely slice into rounds, and arrange on your plates.",
    "Remove the chicken skin and soft scallions from the pan and put aside. Cook the chicken for 10 more minutes, or until tender and cooked through. In a bowl, loosen the hoisin with a splash of red wine vinegar, then spoon over the chicken. Leave it in the oven while you drain and divide up the salad. Sit the chicken and soft scallions on top and crack over the crispy skin."
