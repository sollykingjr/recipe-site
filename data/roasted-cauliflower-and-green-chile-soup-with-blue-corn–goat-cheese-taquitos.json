  "directions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the cauliflower in a large baking dish, toss with the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and using a paring knife, make a few slits in the foil.",
    "2. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until the cauliflower is soft, 25 to 30 minutes, removing the foil and stirring once during cooking.",
    "3. Scrape the cauliflower into a medium saucepan and add the stock. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.",
    "4. Carefully ladle the cauliflower into a blender or a food processor and add a few cups of the stock. Puree until smooth, adding more stock to reach a thick soup consistency. Strain the soup into a clean pot. The soup can be made up to this point 1 day in advance.",
    "5. Bring to a simmer and whisk in the heavy cream and poblano puree and season with salt and pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until just warmed through.",
    "6. Ladle the soup into bowls and top each with 2 or 3 taquitos and a sprinkling of cilantro. Serve hot."
