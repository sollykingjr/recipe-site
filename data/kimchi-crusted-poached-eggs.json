  "directions": [
    "1. Set a medium pot over high heat, fill it halfway with water, and bring it to a simmer.",
    "2. Crack one egg at a time into a small-mesh sieve to drain off any excess white. Gently swirl the pot of water to create a whirlpool and carefully drop the egg directly into the center. Allow the egg to cook until the white is fully set, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully scoop it out and set aside on a paper towel to drain. Repeat with the second egg. (If you\u2019re feeling ambitious, you can do both at the same time.)",
    "3. Set a small pan over medium heat and toast the almonds and bread crumbs, until they are golden brown and fragrant, 2 to 3"
