  "ingredients": [
    "- 2\u00bd pounds seedless watermelon, unpeeled, cut into small, 1-inch-thick wedges",
    "- 37 grams (\u00bc cup) Diamond Crystal kosher salt",

  "directions": [
    "1. Put the watermelon and salt in a large mixing bowl and toss gently to coat. Let it sit for 10 minutes to allow the salt to draw out some liquid from the melon.",
    "2. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the onion, radish, and gochugaru. Mix well.",
    "3. Add the chili paste mixture to the watermelon and toss gently to coat. Firmly pack the paste onto the watermelon wedges to ensure the flesh, rind, and peel are well-covered.",
    "4. Transfer the watermelon mixture to a clean 2-quart glass jar, being careful not to break the wedges. Scrape any leftover mixture into the jar.",
    "5. Press down with a spoon to submerge the watermelon, ensuring the liquid rises. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it against the surface of the mixture. Seal the jar with a lid.",
    "6. Let it ferment at room temperature for 4 to 5 days, burping the container after 2 days.",
    "7. Once fermented to your liking, store in the fridge for up to 6 weeks."
