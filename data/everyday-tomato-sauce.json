  "directions": [
    "1. In a large heavy pot, combine the tomatoes, water, half of the red onions, half of the garlic cloves, and all of the bay leaves. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the tomatoes split, begin to break up, and eventually become a rough puree, about 40 minutes. Make sure to stir the tomatoes occasionally to keep them from sticking, and mash them gently against the side of the pot to help them break down. When the tomatoes are tender, remove the pot from the heat and let cool slightly.2. Set a food mill over a clean pot. Pass the tomato mixture through the mill to separate the skins and pulp. Discard the skins.3. In a food processor, combine the basil leaves and the remaining chopped onion and garlic cloves and pulse until finely chopped. Add to the pot of tomatoes, along with the olive oil. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the mixture has thickened slightly, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the salt and sugar."
