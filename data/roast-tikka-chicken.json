  "ingredients": [
    "1\u00belbs potatoes",
    "1small head of cauliflower (1\u00bc lbs)",
    "1bunch of fresh cilantro (1 oz)",
    "1x 2\u00bd lbs whole chicken",
    "2tablespoons tikka curry paste"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF. Wash the potatoes and chop into 1\u00bc-inch chunks. Trim the cauli stalk, remove any tough outer leaves, then chop the cauli and nice leaves the same size as the spuds. Finely slice the cilantro stalks (reserving the leaves in a bowl of cold water). In a 16- x 12-inch roasting pan, toss the veg and cilantro stalks with a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and 1 tablespoon each of olive oil and red wine vinegar.",
    "Sit the chicken in the pan and rub all over with the tikka paste, getting into all the nooks and crannies. Place the chicken directly on the bars of the oven, scrunch everything in the pan and place exactly underneath the chicken to catch the tasty juices. Roast for 1 hour, or until everything is golden and cooked through, turning the veg halfway. Sit the chicken on top of the veg to rest for 5 minutes, then sprinkle over the drained cilantro leaves and serve, tossing the veg in all the tasty juices before dishing up."
