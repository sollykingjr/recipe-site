  "directions": [
    "1. For the pork: Cut tenderloins in half lengthwise. Transfer to a plate and freeze until firm, about 15 minutes. Slice each half crosswise on bias into 1/2-inch strips, each about 3 inches long. Combine Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add pork strips and toss until evenly coated; set aside. Whisk potato starch, flour, baking powder, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt together in a second large bowl. Whisk in water until smooth; set aside.",
    "2. Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet and line with a triple layer of paper towels. Add peanut oil to a large Dutch oven until it measures about 1 1/2 inches deep and heat over medium-high heat to 350\u00b0F.",
    "3. Whisk batter to recombine. Add half of the pork and gently toss to coat. Using tongs or cooking chopsticks, lift pieces of pork from the batter, dragging them gently against the side of the bowl to remove excess batter, and lower into oil; separate pieces as needed so they fry individually. Fry until pork is light golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Adjust burner, if necessary, to maintain oil temperature between 325\u00b0F and 350\u00b0F. Using a spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer pork to the prepared rack. Return oil to 350\u00b0F and repeat with remaining pork; transfer to the rack.",
    "4. Heat oil to 375\u00b0F. Fry pork a second time all at once until deep golden brown and crisp, 4 to 6 minutes; return to the rack lined with fresh paper towels.",
    "5. For the sauce: Measure out and reserve 2 tablespoons frying oil; discard remaining oil or save for another use. Whisk water, vinegar, sugar, dark soy sauce, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, potato starch, pepper, and reserved frying oil together in a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula, until the mixture is thickened and syrupy and has reduced to about 1 1/4 cups, about 2 minutes. Off heat, add pork and toss until each piece is evenly coated, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and Thai chiles, if using, and serve."
