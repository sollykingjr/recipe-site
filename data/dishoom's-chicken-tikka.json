    "Cut each boneless, skin-on chicken thigh (500g total weight) into 3 pieces. Pat dry with kitchen paper and place in a large bowl.",
    "Add 30g of fresh ginger, 10g of garlic (2-3 cloves), 10g of green chillies (2-3), 30ml of rice vinegar, 1 teaspoon of deggi mirch chilli powder, 1 teaspoon of turmeric, 1\u00bd teaspoons of fine sea salt, 2 teaspoons of sugar and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil into a blender or small food processor and blitz until the ingredients resemble a fine paste.",
    "Pour the marinade into the bowl with the chicken and mix until the chicken is fully coated. Cover and leave in the fridge for 6-24 hours.",
    "Remove the chicken from the fridge 20 minutes before cooking. If your skewers are wooden, soak them in water now to prevent them from burning.",
    "Turn your grill up high. Skewer the chicken, making sure there\u2019s a small gap between the pieces so that the chicken can cook evenly. Brush with 25g of melted butter and grill for 12-15 minutes, turning regularly and brushing with more butter, until the skins have charred to your liking and the chicken is cooked all the way through.",
    "Allow the chicken to rest for 5 minutes then serve immediately with lime wedges on the side. Any leftovers (unlikely) will keep in the fridge for up to 2 days."
