  "ingredients": [
    "1cup short-grain white rice",
    "2scallions",
    "Extra-virgin olive oil",
    "1pound (1 pint) Sungold tomatoes, halved",
    "1tablespoon white miso paste",
    "\u00bdcup hot water",
    "1teaspoon grated fresh ginger",
    "2tablespoons avocado oil"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Cook the rice according to the package directions.",
    "2. Meanwhile, slice the scallions lengthwise into long, thin strips and, if you\u2019d like, add them to an ice bath to get them extra curled up and crisp.",
    "3. Set a small pan over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the tomatoes and let them cook, shaking the pan occasionally until they begin to collapse, 5 to 6 minutes.",
    "4. While the tomatoes are cooking, in a small bowl, whisk the miso paste into the hot water, letting it dissolve fully.",
    "5. Add the miso mixture and ginger to the tomatoes. Let this come to a simmer and cook to reduce by half, 9 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl.",
    "6. Wipe out the pan and add the avocado oil. Set the pan back over medium heat, add the rice, and press down into a flat layer with a spatula. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, undisturbed, until the bottom of the rice is golden and crispy. Then break it into a few big pieces; they don\u2019t have to be perfect. Flip each piece out of the pan onto the tomatoes.",
    "7. Top with the scallions and use a spoon to break the crispy rice to get down to the juicy, tomatoey broth below."
