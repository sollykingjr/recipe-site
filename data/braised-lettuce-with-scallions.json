    "Remove any dark or damaged outer leaves from the lettuce, then cut the little gem in half, or the larger lettuces in quarters, lengthwise so they remain connected. Trim and slice the scallions into 2-inch pieces.",
    "Melt the butter and olive oil in a deep frying or saut\u00e9 pan with a lid over medium-low heat, then add the scallions and lettuces and turn them in the oil and butter before adding the wine, a pinch of salt, and a grind of black pepper. Cover the pan.",
    "Turn the heat to its very lowest and cook gently for 20\u201330 minutes, turning the vegetables every now and then, until they are tender and floppy. If at any point the pan looks dry, add another tablespoon of water or wine, or remove the lid and increase the heat to reduce any excess liquid. Serve immediately or at room temperature."
