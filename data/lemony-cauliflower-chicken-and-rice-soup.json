  "directions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C). Line a sheet tray with parchment paper.",
    "2. Generously season the chicken thighs all over with salt and pepper. Coat the bottom of a large, heavy-bottomed pot with olive oil, and heat over medium heat until the oil begins to ripple. Add the chicken thighs, skin side down, and sear until they are deeply golden and the chicken naturally releases from the pan, 10 to 14 minutes. Flip over the thighs, and cook the second side until lightly seared, 2 or 3 minutes.",
    "3. Transfer the chicken thighs to a plate, and carefully (they will be hot!) peel off the skin using tongs. Place the chicken skins on the sheet tray.",
    "4. Bake the chicken skins for 40 to 45 minutes, until shatteringly crispy. Set aside to cool and then break into irregular shards and reserve for topping the soup.",
    "5. Meanwhile, add the onion, celery, fennel, and garlic to the pot with the chicken drippings. Season with a good pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper, and cook until softened, 5 or 6 minutes. Pour in the broth, and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.",
    "6. Return the chicken and any accumulated drippings to the pot along with the cauliflower, Parmesan rinds, and bay leaves. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, until the chicken is cooked, shreddable, and has an internal temperature of at least 185\u00b0F (85\u00b0C) and the cauliflower is very soft and falling apart, 40 to 45 minutes.",
    "7. Remove the bay leaves and Parmesan rinds. Transfer the chicken thighs to a plate, and shred the meat off the bone using two forks.",
    "8. Whisk the eggs and lemon juice in a medium bowl until homogeneous. While quickly whisking the eggs, add a few ladles of the hot soup to the egg mixture to temper the mixture and bring it up to temperature without scrambling the eggs.",
    "9. Whisk the tempered egg mixture into the pot of soup. Bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, 4 or 5 minutes. Stir in the reserved shredded chicken.",
    "10. To serve, add a small scoop of the cooked rice to each serving bowl and then pour the hot soup over the top. Drizzle with a touch of olive oil, and top with some dill, pecorino Romano, pepper, lemon zest, and crushed pieces of the reserved crispy chicken skin."
