  "ingredients": [
    "One 1-pound boneless rib-eye steak (about 1\u2033 thick), rested at room temperature for 30 minutes",
    "\u00bccup all-purpose flour",
    "1large egg, beaten",
    "1cup panko (plus more as needed)",

    "Soy sauce",
    "Thinly sliced cabbage"
  ],

    "Trim any large chunks of fat from the steak. Slice on the bias into four pieces about 1\u2033 thick. Cover each with plastic wrap and lightly pound to a uniform \u00be\u2033 thickness.",
    "Set up three shallow trays with flour, beaten egg, and panko. Coat each steak piece in flour (shake off excess), dip in egg, then press into panko. Transfer to a plate.",
    "Pour about \u2153\u2033 vegetable oil into a heavy skillet and heat to 350 \u00b0F. (Test by dropping in a few panko crumbs\u2014if they sizzle and brown immediately, it\u2019s ready.) Line a baking sheet with paper towels or a wire rack.",
