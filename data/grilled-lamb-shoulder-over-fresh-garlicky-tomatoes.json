  "directions": [
    "1 Using a knife, separate the lamb shoulder where it naturally wants to separate, into 3 or 4 smaller pieces (almost like a few lamb steaks)\u2014this is to ensure even cooking on the grill.2 Mix the anchovies and olive oil. Season the lamb with salt and pepper and smear with the anchovy mixture (do this at least 30 minutes in advance, uncovered and refrigerated).3 Heat a grill to medium-high. (Or heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large cast iron over medium-high heat.)4 Grill the meat over the hottest part of the grill, flipping frequently to make sure nothing burns. Grill until charred deeply and evenly, 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the piece. (Or sear the pieces of lamb until golden brown on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes per side.) Transfer the lamb to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes.5 Meanwhile, place the tomatoes on a large serving platter and season with salt and pepper. Scatter with the green garlic and lemon juice and set aside. Thinly slice the meat and place immediately atop the tomatoes, letting the juices mingle. Sprinkle with flaky salt and, if desired, serve with aioli, salsa verde, and/or flatbreads."
