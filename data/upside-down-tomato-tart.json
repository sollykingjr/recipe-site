    "Buying the BestGood plum tomatoes are available year-round, but for seasonally ripe tomatoes, buy them at the height of summer. Also try these paths to ripe flavor.Go for LocalBuy locally grown tomatoes. The shorter the distance the tomato has to travel, the riper it can be when picked. Commercial high-yield production strains the tomato plant, resulting in fruit without enough sugars and other flavor compounds that make them tasty. To withstand the rigors of machine harvesting and long-distance transport, commercial varieties are bred to be sturdier, with thicker walls but less of the jelly and seeds that add flavor.Looks Aren\u2019t EverythingOddly shaped tomatoes are fine. Only commercial tomatoes are bred to be perfectly symmetrical. Even cracked skin is OK. Just avoid bruised, overly soft tomatoes, or ones leaking juice. Choose tomatoes that smell fruity and feel heavy."
