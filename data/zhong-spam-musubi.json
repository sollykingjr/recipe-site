  "ingredients": [
    "- 1 (12-oz / 340g) can Spam, cut into eight slices",
    "- \u00bc cup / 60ml Zhong Sauce",
    "- 3 Tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar",
    "- 3 tsp granulated sugar",
    "- \u00be tsp kosher salt",
    "- 3 cups / 600g freshly cooked short grain rice",
    "- 2 sheets nori, cut into eight strips",
    "- 2 Tbsp furikake"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Place the Spam slices in a resealable bag with the Zhong sauce and let them marinate for about 30 minutes.",
    "2. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the vinegar, sugar, and salt and whisk until the salt and sugar are melted and the liquid comes to a simmer, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and drizzle the liquid onto the rice, folding it in gently until fully incorporated.",
    "3. In a large nonstick pan over medium heat, cook the Spam slices in batches of two, with extra Zhong marinade spooned on top, until caramelized on both sides, 3 to 5 minutes total.",
    "4. Situate the musubi mold in the center of a nori strip. Place \u2153 cup / 60g of the rice into the musubi mold and press down. Sprinkle the rice with the furikake and top with a slice of Spam. Remove the mold and wrap the nori around the musubi and wet the edges to seal. Make the rest of the musubi with the remaining rice and Spam.",
    "5. You can consume musubis immediately or make them ahead, wrapping them in plastic wrap and storing at room temperature for up to a few hours. The rice doesn\u2019t refrigerate well, so try to consume the same day you make them."
