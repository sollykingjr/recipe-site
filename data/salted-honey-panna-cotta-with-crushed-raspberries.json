  "ingredients": [
    "1(\u00bc-ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin powder",
    "\u00bccup water",
    "3cups heavy cream, divided",
    "\u00bdcup plus 2 tablespoons honey, plus more for garnish",
    "1cup buttermilk (see this page)",
    "1cup sour cream",
    "\u00bdvanilla bean, split and seeds scraped (optional)",
    "Pinch of kosher salt",
    "6ounces fresh raspberries",
    "1tablespoon apple cider vinegar, or fresh lime or lemon juice"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Sprinkle the envelope of gelatin over the water and let sit 2 or 3 minutes to soften and hydrate (so that it doesn\u2019t clump).2 Add the squishy gelatin to a small pot along with \u00bd cup cream and \u00bd cup honey. Heat over low heat, swirling the pot until the gelatin is totally dissolved, making sure not to simmer.3 Gently whisk the buttermilk, sour cream, vanilla, if using, remaining 2\u00bd cups cream, and a pinch of salt in a large bowl.4 Slowly whisk the warm gelatin mixture into the buttermilk mixture, taking care not to whisk too hard or else it\u2019ll trap air bubbles (you don\u2019t want that). Divide the mixture among 6 to 10 glasses. Chill until the panna cotta is set, at least 1 hour.5 Meanwhile, place the raspberries, vinegar, and remaining 2 tablespoons honey in a medium bowl. Using a fork, crush the fruit to release the juices. Serve the panna cotta topped with the crushed raspberry mixture, additional honey, or nothing at all."
