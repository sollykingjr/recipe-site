  "ingredients": [
    "2cups medium-grain rice (like this one, not quick cook or partially cooked rice)",
    "Water",
    "1cup broken vermicelli pasta",
    "2 1/2tbsp olive oil",
    "Salt",
    "1/2cup toasted pine nuts, optional for garnish"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Rinse the rice well then place it in a medium bowl and cover with water. Soak for 20 minutes. Test to see if you can easily break a grain of rice by simply placing it between your thumb and index finger. Drain well.",
    "In a medium non-stick cooking pot, heat the olive oil on medium-high. Add the vermicelli and continuously stir to toast it evenly. Vermicelli should turn a nice golden brown, but watch carefully not to over-brown or burn it (If it burns, you must throw the vermicelli away and start over).",
    "Add the rice and continue to stir so that the rice will be well-coated with the olive oil. Season with salt.",
    "Now add 3 1/2 cups of water and bring it to a boil until the water significantly reduces (see the photo below).Turn the heat to low and cover.",
    "Cook for 15-20 minutes on low. Once fully cooked, turn the heat off and leave the rice undisturbed in it\u2019s cooking pot for 10-15 minutes, then uncover and fluff with a fork.",
    "Transfer to a serving platter and top with the toasted pine nuts. Enjoy!"
