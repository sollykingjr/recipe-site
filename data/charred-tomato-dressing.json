  "ingredients": [
    "3globe tomatoes, various colors (or Roma, tomatoes on the vine, or beefsteak)",
    "2tablespoons red wine vinegar, plus more to taste",
    "2garlic cloves, grated",
    "\u00bdteaspoon red pepper flakes",
    "Diamond Crystal kosher salt",
    "Freshly ground black pepper",
    "Extra-virgin olive oil"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Position a rack in the center of the oven and set the broiler to high.",
    "Place the tomatoes on a sheet pan and broil until the skin is charred and peeling, about 10 minutes. Broilers can be incredibly fickle, so start checking for char marks after 5 minutes. Flip and char the other side, until the tomatoes are soft and begin to release some of their juices, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and set aside.",
    "Once the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, coarsely chop them into small pieces. In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, their juices, the vinegar and garlic. Season with the pepper flakes, \u00bd teaspoon salt, and \u00bc teaspoon black pepper. Add 3 tablespoons olive oil and stir. Taste and adjust with more salt, black pepper, and oil as needed."
