    "1. To make the custards, put the gelatin in a small bowl, cover with cold water, and let soak for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the buttermilk, cream, and milk together in a saucepan to just below boiling point. Add the sugar and stir until it has completely dissolved. Remove the gelatin from the soaking liquid and squeeze out any excess water. Add to the hot buttermilk mixture and stir until completely dissolved. Pour through a fine strainer and fill four dariole molds or individual dessert molds. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill for several hours, or overnight, until set.",
    "2. To make the blackberry soup, put the blackberries, wine, and water in a large saucepan with the sugar and star anise. Simmer gently for 8\u201310 minutes, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture has a lovely anise scent. Remove from the heat and let cool. Once the mixture has cooled, remove and discard the star anise, transfer the mixture to a food processor, and blend until smooth. Pour through a fine strainer and stir in the liqueur, if using. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.",
    "3. To serve, divide the blackberry soup among four shallow bowls and place a buttermilk custard in the center of each."
