    "\u00bcteaspoon table salt",
    "\u00bdcup water",
    "2tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces",

  "directions": [
    "1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set in second rimmed baking sheet. In 2-cup liquid measuring cup, beat eggs and white and salt until well combined. (You should have about \u00bd cup egg mixture. Discard excess.) Set aside.",
    "2. Heat water, butter, and cayenne in small saucepan over medium heat. When mixture begins to simmer, reduce heat to low and immediately stir in flour using wooden spoon. Cook, stirring constantly, using smearing motion, until mixture is very thick, forms ball, and pulls away from sides of saucepan, about 30 seconds.",
    "3. Immediately transfer mixture to food processor and process with feed tube open for 5 seconds to cool slightly. With processor running, gradually add reserved egg mixture in steady stream, then scrape down sides of bowl and add Gruy\u00e8re. Process until paste is very glossy and flecked with coarse cornmeal\u2013size pieces of cheese, 30 to 40 seconds. (If not using immediately, transfer paste to bowl, press sheet of greased parchment directly on surface, and store at room temperature for up to 2 hours.)",
    "4. Scoop 1 level tablespoon of dough. Using second small spoon, scrape dough onto prepared sheet into 1\u00bd-inch-wide, 1-inch-tall mound. Repeat, spacing mounds 1 to 1\u00bc inches apart. (You should have 24 mounds.) Using back of spoon lightly coated with vegetable oil spray, smooth away any creases and large peaks on each mound.",
    "5. Bake until goug\u00e8res are puffed and upper two-thirds of each are light golden brown (bottom third will still be pale), 14 to 20 minutes. Turn off oven; leave goug\u00e8res in oven until uniformly golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes (do not open oven for at least 8 minutes). Transfer goug\u00e8res to wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Serve warm. (Cooled goug\u00e8res can be stored in airtight container at room temperature for up to 24 hours or frozen in zipper-lock bag for up to 1 month. To serve, crisp goug\u00e8res in 300-degree oven for about 7 minutes.)"
