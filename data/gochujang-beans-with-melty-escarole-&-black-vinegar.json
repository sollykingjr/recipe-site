  "directions": [
    "1. Set a large pan over medium heat and add the butter. Let it melt, then cook, stirring occasionally, until the milk solids begin to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn down the heat and add the shallots, stirring occasionally, until the shallots have softened and the butter is lightly golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes.",
    "2. Meanwhile, in a large cup, whisk together the garlic, ginger, gochujang, vinegar, soy sauce, maple syrup, and 1 cup water.",
    "3. Add the beans to the pan and give it a swirl to coat everything. Pour in the gochujang mixture, increase the heat to medium, and bring to a soft simmer. Let the sauce reduce by half, stirring occasionally, 5 to 6 minutes.",
    "4. When the sauce becomes thick and glossy, add the escarole and let it wilt into the beans. This will take a matter of seconds.",
    "5. To serve, portion into four bowls and dot each bowl with at least 1 tablespoon black vinegar, plus more as preferred."
