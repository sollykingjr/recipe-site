  "ingredients": [
    "a large bunch of flat-leaf parsley",
    "a large bunch of basil",
    "a handful of mint",
    "a small tin of anchovy fillets in oil, drained",
    "a handful of capers, rinsed if salted",
    "2garlic cloves",
    "1teaspoon red wine vinegar",
    "extra-virgin olive oil",
    "black pepper"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "To make the sauce by hand, chop the herbs very finely with a knife or, better still, a mezzaluna (a two-handled crescent-shaped chopper). Roughly chop the anchovies and capers and mix them with the herbs in a large bowl. Peel and smash the garlic with the back of a knife, then chop it very finely and add it to the bowl. Add the vinegar, if using, then stir in the olive oil a little at a time until you have a dense, spoonable sauce. Taste and season it with pepper. The anchovies and capers mean you probably won\u2019t need extra salt.",
    "To make it in a food processor or blender, pulse-chop the herbs, anchovies, capers, and garlic until roughly blended. Transfer to a large bowl, add the vinegar, if using, then add the olive oil, stirring continuously until you have a dense, spoonable sauce."
