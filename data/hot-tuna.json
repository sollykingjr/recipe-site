    "2juicy lemons, for zesting and juicing",
    "Two 5-ounce cans oil-packed tuna",
    "2garlic cloves, peeled",
    "1jalape\u00f1o",
    "\u00bdcup mayo (Duke\u2019s or bust)",
    "2teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, or more if you like",
    "1teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal or about half as much Morton), or more if you like",
    "1teaspoon fish sauce",
    "1teaspoon crushed Calabrian chiles, or \u00bd teaspoon red chile flakes",
    "\u00bccup lightly packed picked dill",
    "10or so basil leaves, torn",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "Put the giardiniera in a small mixing bowl. Use a Microplane to zest one of the lemons over the giardiniera, then halve the lemons and squeeze in the juice of one of the halves. Stir well and set aside.",
    "Dump the tuna (oil and all) into a medium mixing bowl and break up into little chunks with a fork. Use a Microplane to grate the garlic and jalape\u00f1o into the bowl. It\u2019s fine if some chile seeds get in there. Add the mayo, black pepper, salt, and fish sauce, then squeeze in a couple of tablespoons lemon juice. Stir and mash really well until it\u2019s as smooth as deli tuna salad. Season with more salt and lemon juice until you\u2019re happy.",
    "Put the tuna salad in a serving bowl or on a plate and spoon in the giardiniera mixture. Top with the Calabrian chiles, then the dill and basil. Serve it alongside bread or crackers."
