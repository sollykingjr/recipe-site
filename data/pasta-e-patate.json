    "1onion",
    "1large carrot",
    "1celery stalk",
    "about 2 ounces guanciale or pancetta (optional)",
    "5tablespoons olive oil",

    "7ounces small pasta or broken spaghetti",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "Finely dice the onion, carrot, and celery. If you are using it, finely chop the guanciale or pancetta along with the vegetables. Heat the olive oil in a deep frying pan or heavy-based soup pan, add the vegetables and guanciale, and cook gently until soft and fragrant. This should take about 8 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, dice the potatoes into 1-inch cubes and add them to the pan, stirring so that each piece glistens with oil. Add 6\u00bd cups of water to cover the vegetables by at least 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook gently for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft. Taste and season with salt.",
    "Add the pasta and increase the heat so that the soup boils for 8 minutes, adding more hot water if necessary\u2014it should be dense but soupy\u2014and stirring so the pasta doesn\u2019t stick. Taste and add more salt if necessary, and a few grinds of black pepper. Serve directly from the pan, passing around a bowl of grated Parmesan or pecorino for people to stir into their soup. Or, more correctly\u2014at least, more traditionally\u2014you should pour the soup into a tureen or soup bowl, stir in 6 tablespoons grated cheese, then serve at the table."
