    "Add chicken (and any accumulated juices), bring to a simmer and cook, turning and basting occasionally with the sauce, until cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees, 6 to 8 minutes.",
    "Divide chicken among 4 serving plates and discard thyme.",
    "Add lemon juice to the skillet and stir until sauce is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and stir in parsley.",
    "Spoon the sauce over the chicken and garnish with more parsley. Serve with crusty bread or egg noodles, if desired."
