  "ingredients": [
    "- 4 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided",
    "- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger",
    "- 1 garlic clove, minced",
    "- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce",
    "- 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil",
    "- 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch",
    "- 8 small heads baby bok choy (1 1/2 to 2 ounces each), halved lengthwise, washed thoroughly, and spun dry",
    "- 2 tablespoons water"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Combine 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, ginger, and garlic in a small bowl; set aside. Whisk oyster sauce, sesame oil, and cornstarch together in a second small bowl; set aside.",
    "2. Heat an empty 14-inch flat-bottomed wok over high heat until just beginning to smoke. Reduce heat to medium, drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil around the perimeter of the wok, and heat until just smoking. Add bok choy and water (water will sputter), cover, and cook, shaking the wok occasionally, for 2 minutes.",
    "3. Uncover, toss bok choy, then push it to one side of the wok. Add the ginger-garlic mixture to the clearing and cook, mashing the mixture into the wok, until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Stir the ginger-garlic mixture into bok choy and continue to cook, tossing slowly but constantly, until all the water has evaporated, stems are crisp-tender, and leaves are wilted, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add the oyster sauce mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce has thickened and coats the bok choy, about 15 seconds. Serve."
