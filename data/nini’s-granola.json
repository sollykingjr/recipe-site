  "ingredients": [
    "\u2154cup unsweetened shredded coconut",
    "3cups rolled oats",
    "One 10\u00bd-ounce can (2 cups) salted roasted mixed nuts, roughly chopped",
    "\u00bdcup grapeseed oil or mild olive oil",
    "\u00bdcup packed light brown sugar",
    "\u2153cup maple syrup",
    "2teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal or about half as much Morton)",
    "\u00bdcup golden raisins",
    "\u00bccup dried currants"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Get your oven to 325\u00b0F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Spread the shredded coconut on the baking sheet and bake, rotating the pan halfway through, until light brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Dump the coconut into a small bowl and let it hang out.",
    "Turn your oven temp to 275\u00b0F.",
    "Mix together the oats and chopped mixed nuts in a large heatproof bowl. In a small pot, get the oil, brown sugar, maple syrup, and salt to a boil, stirring occasionally, then dump the mixture into the bowl. Mix it all real good to coat the oats and nuts.",
    "On that same parchment paper\u2013lined baking sheet, evenly spread the oat mixture into more or less a single layer and bake until the oats turn a nice caramel color, 2 to 2\u00bd hours. Give it a little stir every 45 minutes or so, but if you like clusters, not so much near the end.",
    "Take the mixture out of the oven and let it cool a bit. Add the toasted coconut, raisins, and currants and mix it all together. Let it cool completely, when it shall fulfill its crunchy promise.",
    "Eat it now or keep it in an airtight container at room temp for up to 1 month."
