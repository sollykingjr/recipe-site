  "ingredients": [
    "FOR THE PEANUT BRITTLE",
    "- 3 cups granulated sugar",
    "- 1\u215b cups light corn syrup",
    "- 3 cups raw peanuts",
    "- 1 tablespoon unsalted vegan butter",
    "- 2\u00bd tablespoons baking soda",
    "- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "MAKE THE PEANUT BRITTLE:- LINE a large sheet pan with wax paper or a silicone mat.- IN a Dutch oven or medium pot that\u2019s nice and deep (since when you add the baking soda later, the mixture will bubble up), bring the sugar, corn syrup, and \u00bd cup water to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Lower the heat and simmer until the syrup reaches the \u201cthread stage,\u201d about 5 minutes. Unless you\u2019re familiar with the stages of sugar syrup, I recommend a candy thermometer here; it should read 230 to 235\u00b0F.- STIR in the peanuts and cook until the nuts turn tan and start to smell roasted and the candy thermometer registers 290\u00baF, about 12 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the vegan butter, baking soda, and vanilla. Watch it bubble! Stir really well to distribute the baking soda.- IMMEDIATELY pour the brittle onto the prepared baking sheet. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Alternatively, while the brittle is still warm, sandwich it between silicone baking sheets or wax paper and roll out to a thin layer (about \u00bc inch) with a rolling pin. Once the brittle cools, break it into pieces."
