  "ingredients": [
    "1tablespoon raw sesame seeds",
    "4large chicken wings",
    "2tablespoons teriyaki sauce",
    "1fresh red chili",
    "2scallions"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Toast the sesame seeds in a dry 8-inch non-stick frying pan on a medium heat until lightly golden, then remove to a plate. Still on the heat, sit the wings in the pan \u2013 they should fit snugly. Let them color for 1 minute on each side, then add the teriyaki and just cover the wings with water. Halve the chili lengthways and add to the pan. Simmer for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce is nice and sticky, turning occasionally.",
    "Add a splash of red wine vinegar to the pan and jiggle around to pick up the gnarly bits. Trim and finely slice the scallions, scatter them over the chicken with the toasted sesame seeds, and get stuck in."
