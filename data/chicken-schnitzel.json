  "directions": [
    "1. Spread flour in shallow dish. Beat eggs and oil in second shallow dish. Place bread crumbs in third shallow dish. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet. Line second rimmed baking sheet with double layer of paper towels. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees.2. Starting at thick end, cut each chicken breast in half horizontally. Pound cutlets to uniform \u00bc-inch thickness. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Sprinkle each cutlet on both sides with \u00be teaspoon salt and \u215b teaspoon pepper.3. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge cutlets thoroughly in flour, shaking off excess, then coat with egg mixture, allowing excess to drip back into dish to ensure very thin coating. Coat evenly with bread crumbs, pressing on crumbs to adhere. Place cutlets on prepared wire rack, taking care not to overlap cutlets and let sit for 5 minutes.4. Add 2 cups oil to large Dutch oven and heat over medium-high heat to 350 degrees. Lay 2 or 3 cutlets (depending on size) in oil, without overlapping them, and cook, shaking pot continuously and gently, until cutlets are wrinkled and light golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer cutlets to paper towel\u2013lined baking sheet, flip to blot excess oil, and transfer sheet to oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining cutlets. Serve immediately with lemon wedges."
