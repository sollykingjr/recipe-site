    "1. For the dough: Process wheat starch, tapioca starch, and salt in food processor until combined, about 3 seconds. Add boiling water and let rest for 5 seconds. Pulse once. Add lard and process until dough forms ball that clears sides of processor bowl, about 1 minute. If dough does not come together, add up to 2 teaspoons hot water, 1/2 teaspoon at a time, processing for 10 seconds between additions, until dough ball forms. Transfer to lightly greased counter and knead for 1 minute. Dough should be slightly tacky. Shape dough into ball, and cover with plastic wrap.",
    "2. For the filling: In clean, dry workbowl, pulse all ingredients until shrimp is finely ground, 10 to 20 pulses. Transfer to bowl, cover, and refrigerate until filling is well chilled, about 20 minutes.",
    "3. Divide dough into 4 equal portions. On lightly greased counter, roll 1 portion of dough into 6-inch rope. Divide rope into 6 equal pieces. Cover all pieces with plastic. Using lightly oiled tortilla press or pie plate, press 1 piece of dough into 3 1/4-inch round.",
    "4. Place dough round on fingers of nondominant hand. Place heaping 1/2 tablespoon filling in center of dough. To create first pleat, use thumb and index finger of dominant hand to pinch dough above pinky and lift pleat toward top of filling.",
    "5. Using index finger of hand holding dumpling, push dough toward pinched portion to begin forming second pleat. Use index finger of dominant hand to position second pleat against first pleat. Repeat pleating motion, rotating dough with each pleat, until all of dough is pleated and dumpling has rounded shape.",
    "6. Holding dumpling pleated side up, use thumb and index finger to press pleats together just above filling to seal dumpling. Gently tear excess dough from dumpling. Place dumpling pleated side up on counter and cover with plastic. Repeat with remaining dough and filling, lightly oiling tortilla press and counter as needed.",
    "7. Bring 4 cups water to boil in 14-inch flat-bottomed wok. Poke about 20 small holes in two 9-inch parchment rounds and lightly coat with vegetable oil spray. Place rounds in two 10-inch bamboo steamer baskets. Arrange 12 dumplings in each prepared basket so that they are not touching; stack baskets and cover. Reduce heat to maintain vigorous simmer and set steamer in wok. Steam until har gow wrappers are translucent, about 8 minutes. Off heat, remove steamer from wok and let rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Serve immediately."
