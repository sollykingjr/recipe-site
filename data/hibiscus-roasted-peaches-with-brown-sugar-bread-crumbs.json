    "1 Make the bread crumbs. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the fresh bread crumbs and toss to coat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bread crumbs start to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the brown sugar and continue to cook until the brown sugar has begun to caramelize as the bread crumbs take on a deep golden brown color, another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and season with flaky salt.2 Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.3 For the peaches and assembly. Place the peaches, cut side down, in a large baking dish. Sprinkle with the sugar and add the hibiscus, lemon juice, and water.4 Roast the peaches, without turning, until the edges are bubbling and a good, syrupy sauce has formed in the baking dish, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Serve the peaches over ice cream and topped with bread crumbs."
