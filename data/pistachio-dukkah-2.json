    "Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F (145\u00b0C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Heat a small dry skillet over medium heat. Toast the cumin and coriander, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until just fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes (this happens quickly, so stick around and make sure the spices don\u2019t burn). Transfer to a small plate and let cool. Toast the sesame seeds in the same pan, stirring frequently, until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a small plate and let cool.",
    "Scatter the pistachios on the baking sheet in a single layer. Toast in the oven until slightly fragrant and drier, 15 to 20 minutes. Keep an eye on them\u2014toasted pistachios should retain their green color; if they turn brown, you\u2019ve toasted them too long and must start again with a new batch of nuts. (Don\u2019t worry, it happens.) Transfer the pistachios to a plate and let cool; leave the oven on.",
    "Scatter the coconut flakes on the baking sheet and toast in the oven until they turn golden, 6 to 8 minutes, stirring halfway through to make sure the coconut toasts evenly.",
    "Grind the toasted cumin and coriander in a spice or coffee grinder or using a pestle and mortar; in both cases, you want the texture to remain slightly coarse. Transfer to a medium bowl.",
    "Pulse the cooled pistachios in a food processor until finely chopped, then transfer to the bowl with the cumin and coriander. Add the toasted sesame seeds, toasted coconut flakes, salt, and a few twists of black pepper. Stir thoroughly to combine.",
    "Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place for up to 2 months."
