  "ingredients": [
    "300g / 10 oz snap peas (about 60)",
    "1\u00bdlemons, cut in half and seeds removed",
    "1(3 by 1-inch) piece lardo",
    "28g / 2 Tbsp olive oil",
    "18grinds black pepper",
    "3g / 1 tsp flaky sea salt"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1   Remove the peas and lemons from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature.2   Cut the lardo into 2-inch cubes. Place a small saucepan over low heat. Add the lardo and slowly render until the pieces have liquefied, 6 to 8 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer (lardo is cured with a lot of spices and herbs, and you want the fat to be very clean) into a separate small saucepan. You should have about 40g / 3 Tbsp.3   Remove the stem from each snap pea by snapping it from the top and pulling the stringy part with it (this part can be a bit tough to bite through, so it\u2019s best to remove).4   Lay each pea on its side and, using a sharp paring knife, split it in half along the seam; you are cutting right through the center so that when you open up the pod, like a book, each side should have sliced peas still attached. Try to keep the halved peas on each side intact as much as possible.5   As you cut the peas, carefully lay the halves, cut side up, in a single layer on a serving platter. A little overlapping is okay.6   Place the saucepan with the lardo over low heat. Heat until the lardo is just warmed, about 30 seconds.7   Drizzle the lardo over the snap peas. If the lardo or peas are too cool, the lardo will tighten up and coagulate. Be sure the peas are at room temp and that you warm the lardo sufficiently.8   Squeeze the juice from the lemon halves evenly over the snap peas. Drizzle with the olive oil and season with the pepper and salt."
