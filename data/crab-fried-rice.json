    "\u00bccup peanut or vegetable oil",
    "1large onion, sliced",

    "Chili Oil (recipe follows), for drizzling",
    "Fresh cilantro, for garnish"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Cook the rice 2 minutes less than the package directions so it is al dente. Spread the rice on a baking sheet to cool quickly and prevent it from overcooking and getting mushy. (If you\u2019re using cold leftover rice, put it in a bowl or on a rimmed baking sheet and break it up so it\u2019s not in huge clumps.)",
    "In a large wok or very large saut\u00e9 pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add the onion and cook until just soft, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the scallions and garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the eggs, letting them sit and cook for 20 seconds until partially set, then add the rice and then the soy sauce, mixing everything together and breaking up the eggs as you do. Cook, stirring, until the rice is hot. Add the tomato and crab and cook until warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Drizzle with chili oil to taste and garnish with scallion greens and cilantro."
