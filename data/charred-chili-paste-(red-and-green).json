  "directions": [
    "STIR together the vinegar and mushroom seasoning powder in a small mixing bowl.",
    "POSITION an oven rack about 4 inches from the broiler and preheat the broiler. Put the chilies on a sheet pan, drizzle with the oil, and toss well to coat them. Arrange them in a single layer and broil, turning over the chilies once about halfway through, until they\u2019re blistered and blackened, 8 to 10 minutes for the red chilies and about 20 minutes for the green chilies. Let them cool a bit.",
    "PULL the stems off the chilies, but don\u2019t deseed them or remove the skins. Add the chilies to a food processor and pulse until fairly finely chopped, then add the vinegar mixture and pulse until well mixed but still a little chunky.",
    "IT keeps in the fridge for up to 1 month."
