  "ingredients": [
    "2pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed and sliced about \u00bc inch thick (better they are too thin than too thick)",
    "\u00bccup distilled white vinegar",
    "\u00bccup olive oil",
    "1teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes",
    "1teaspoon smoked paprika",
    "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1small garlic clove, finely chopped",
    "\u00bccup finely chopped fresh parsley, tender leaves and stems, or chives"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.",
    "2 Combine the potatoes, vinegar, oil, crushed red pepper flakes, and paprika on a rimmed baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper and toss to coat.",
    "3 Roast, tossing occasionally, until deeply golden brown and starting to crisp, just like a potato chip, 20 to 25 minutes.",
    "4 Meanwhile, combine the garlic and parsley in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper.",
    "5 Let the potatoes cool a little bit. (Resist the urge to eat one straight from the oven: it will burn your mouth, and while I\u2019d like to say they are worth it, nothing is, okay?) Then, sprinkle with the parsley mixture and serve with literally anything."
