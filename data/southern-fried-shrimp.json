  "ingredients": [
    "2dozen large shrimp, peeled",
    "\u00bdteaspoon plus 1\u00bd tablespoons salt",
    "\u00bcteaspoon plus 1 tablespoon ground black pepper",
    "2cups all-purpose flour",
    "2teaspoons cayenne pepper",
    "Peanut oil, for frying",
    "1cup well-shaken buttermilk",
    "2teaspoons Creole (or whole-grain) mustard (optional\u2014if you want your shrimp tangier)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Place the shrimp in a medium bowl and season with \u00bd teaspoon salt and \u00bc teaspoon black pepper.In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour with the remaining salt, pepper, and the cayenne.Heat 3\u20134 inches of oil in a large pot until very hot, about 350\u00b0F (see Note).Pour the buttermilk (and mustard, if using) over the seasoned shrimp and combine. Working in batches, use a slotted spoon to remove the shrimp from the buttermilk and transfer to the seasoned flour. Using a separate dry spoon or your fingers, toss to evenly coat. Carefully slip the battered shrimp into the fryer and fry until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes; drain on paper towels. (Don\u2019t overcrowd the fryer with too many shrimp, as this will lower the temperature of the oil and the shrimp won\u2019t crisp up as quickly or nicely as they should.)"
