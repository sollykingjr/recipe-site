  "directions": [
    "\u2460 Pickle the red onions:",
    "\u2726Slice 2 red onions crosswise into \u215b-inch-thick rings.",
    "\u2726In a small saucepan, heat 1 cup white vinegar, 1\u00bd cups water, \u00bd cup sugar, and 1 tablespoon salt over medium heat, stirring often to dissolve. Once the vinegar mixture comes to a simmer, remove from the heat and immediately add the onions. Let cool to room temperature. The onions can be made up to several days in advance; they only get better with time.",
    "\u2461 Make the garlic yogurt:",
    "\u2726Finely grate 1 garlic clove into a small bowl and stir in 1 cup plain yogurt. Season with salt and set aside for serving.",
    "\u2462 Marinate the chicken:",
    "\u2726Finely grate 4 garlic cloves into a large bowl.",
    "\u2726Stir in \u00be cup plain yogurt, the juice of 1 lemon, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, 2\u00bd teaspoons salt, 1 tablespoon smoked paprika, 1 tablespoon cumin, \u00be teaspoon cinnamon, and \u00bd teaspoon cayenne pepper and whisk well to combine.",
    "\u2726Add 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs to the marinade and turn to coat. Let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes while you prepare a grill for medium heat (or heat a cast-iron grill pan over medium heat). If you\u2019re going to marinate them longer (which you totes should; they only improve with time), cover and keep chilled in the refrigerator for up to 6 hours and pull them out 30 minutes before cooking.",
    "\u2463 Back to grilling that chicken:",
    "\u2726Once the grill is preheated to medium (you should be able to hold your hand over the grate for about 5 seconds before it gets too hot), lightly oil the grill grates.",
    "\u2726Remove the chicken from the marinade with tongs, letting any excess drip back into the bowl, and transfer it to the grill. Cook, undisturbed, until it\u2019s nicely charred underneath and naturally releases from the grates, 5 to 6 minutes. Pay attention to the hot spots of your grill or grill pan, and move the thighs around accordingly to ensure even browning. Flip the thighs and cook until just cooked through, 4 to 7 minutes longer. (An instant-read thermometer should register 165\u00b0F in the thickest part of the thigh.) This will vary depending on how large your chicken thighs are, so keep an eye on temperature more than timing in this case! Let the chicken thighs rest on a plate while you grill the pitas.",
    "\u2464 Warm the pitas and serve:",
    "\u2726Warm the pitas on the grill while the chicken rests, about 1 minute per side.",
    "\u2726Cut a lemon into 4 wedges and pick the leaves from 1 bunch of mint.",
    "\u2726Slice the chicken against the grain into \u00bd-inch-thick strips and serve on a big platter alongside the pitas, pickled onions, garlic yogurt, lemon wedges, and mint for a build-your-own kinda sitch."
