  "directions": [
    "Separate the broccoli crown from the stem. Trim the end off the stem, peel it, and cut it crosswise into \u00bc-inch-thick coins. Separate the crown into small florets.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together the sweet soy, soybean paste, fish sauce, and less-sodium soy. This is your sauce.",
    "In a wok or very large saut\u00e9 pan, cook the bacon over medium heat until just gently crisped (I mean, don\u2019t go crazy; just get most of the fat rendered), 6 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and chile powder and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Increase the heat to medium-high, add the sauce, and cook until reduced slightly, about 1 minute. Add the broccoli, splash with half the chicken broth, and cook until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Increase the heat to high. Add the spaghetti and the rest of the broth and cook, tossing, until very hot and the sauce is absorbed, 3 to 5 minutes (if it feels too dry, splash in more broth or water a little at a time). Season with additional soy sauce and fish sauce to taste.",
    "Remove the pan from the heat, add the eggs, and toss until the eggs are creamy. Toss in the scallions and serve."
