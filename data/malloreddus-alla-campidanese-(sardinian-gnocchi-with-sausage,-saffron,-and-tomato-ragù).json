  "directions": [
    "1. To make the rag\u00f9, combine the pork, the 15g / 3 cloves chopped garlic, fennel seed, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix well but gently so as not to break up the fat too much. Make a small patty to test your seasoning.",
    "2. Place a small saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Add the test patty and cook, turning once, until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Check your seasoning and add more salt to the pork mixture q.b. Refrigerate until ready to use.",
    "3. In a small bowl, combine the saffron and wine. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes to bloom.",
    "4. Place a large, heavy sauce pot or Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add 56g / \u00bc cup of the olive oil and the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Toward the very end of cooking, add the 25g / 5 cloves garlic and gently cook until aromatic but without color, 10 to 15 seconds. Set aside.",
    "5. Place a large saut\u00e9 pan over high heat. Add the remaining 56g / \u00bc cup oil and begin to cook the pork in batches, one-third of the volume at a time. As the pork starts to brown, break it up with tongs or a wooden spoon into very small, uniform crumbled pieces. Cook until there is no pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to the pot. Repeat with the remaining batches.",
    "6. Return the sauce pot to low heat. Add the bloomed saffron and wine and cook until reduced by about half, 5 to 6 minutes.",
    "7. Add the tomatoes with their juices to the sauce pot and stir to combine. Cook until the flavors have melded, about 1 hour.",
    "8. Measure out 512g / 2\u00bc cups rag\u00f9 and set aside. Transfer the remainder to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 1 month for another use.",
    "9. To finish, following the instructions for malloreddus on this page, make 624g / 1 lb 6 oz with the pasta dough.",
    "10. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Generously salt the water.",
    "11. Place a large saut\u00e9 pan over low heat. Add the rag\u00f9 and 2 to 3 ladles (115g to 170g / \u00bd to \u00be cup) pasta cooking water and stir to combine.",
    "12. Add the malloreddus to the water and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until tender but not soft.",
    "13. Using a pasta basket or spider, remove the pasta from the pot and transfer to the saut\u00e9 pan. Turn the heat up to medium. Toss for 1 to 2 minutes to marry the pasta and the rag\u00f9. If the sauce begins to tighten, add a splash of pasta cooking water to loosen and continue tossing to marry. The rag\u00f9 should nicely coat the pasta without clumping in the pan.",
    "14. Divide the pasta into bowls and finely grate the fiore sardo over the top."
