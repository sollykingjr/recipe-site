  "directions": [
    "1. To make the vinaigrette, combine the anchovies, chile flakes, vinegar, and olive oil in a bowl and mix well. Set aside until ready to use.2. To make the crispy garlic, line a plate with paper towels. Place a saut\u00e9 pan over low heat and add the olive oil. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the slices begin to turn golden and harden slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. They will curl up a bit and cluster together as they cook, so be sure to stir occasionally to ensure even coloring.3. Using a slotted spoon, remove the garlic and place in one layer on the paper towels to drain. If they aren\u2019t fully crispy, do not worry. They will crisp up as they drain and dry.4. To finish, discard any bruised outer leaves from the escarole, then cut the escarole in half lengthwise and rinse well to remove any dirt from the inner leaves. Pat dry with a kitchen towel.5. Place a large saut\u00e9 pan over high heat. Add the olive oil.6. Season the cut side of the escarole with salt q.b., making sure to open the leaves to get inside. (The anchovy and ricotta salata are both salty, so don\u2019t go too heavy.)7. Add the escarole, cut side down, to the pan. Place another heavy pan on top of the escarole to weight it down and get the most possible surface contact.8. Cook the escarole until it is golden on the cut surface and wilted but still has a bit of bite, 3 to 5 minutes.9. Turn off the heat and flip the escarole over in the pan. Add the vinegar to the pan. It will create a bit of steam and evaporate rather quickly.10. Using tongs, transfer the escarole, seared side up, to a serving platter. Spoon the vinaigrette over the escarole, shave the ricotta salata over the top, and garnish with the crispy garlic."
