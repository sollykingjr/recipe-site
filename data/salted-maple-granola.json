    "\u00bdcup chopped pecans",
    "\u00bdcup sliced almonds",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the oats, coconut, pecans, almonds, and sunflower seeds. In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt. Add to the oat mixture and toss together. Spread the granola on the baking sheet and bake until golden brown, stirring occasionally, 25 to 30 minutes (the edges will get a nice, dark brown color, but if you think the nuts are entering Burnville, pull it). Remove from the oven, cool completely, and stir in the cherries. Granola keeps, stored in an airtight container, for up to 2 weeks."
