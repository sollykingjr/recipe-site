Let them toast and get dark golden and nutty, tossing occasionally, while you peel and finely slice the red onion and slice the chicken breasts into \u00bd-inch-thick strips.",
    "When the mushrooms look good, add the onion and chicken to the pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 5 minutes, tossing often, then add the mustard, cream, and \u2154 cup of water. Bring to a boil, then simmer until you\u2019ve just got a loose saucy consistency and the chicken is cooked through. Taste, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, and dish up."
