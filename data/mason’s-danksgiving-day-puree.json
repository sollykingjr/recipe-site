  "ingredients": [
    "3\u00bepounds (about 5) sweet potatoes",
    "2large medium-tart apples, like Pink Lady or Honeycrisp",
    "1stick (8 tablespoons) plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter",
    "\u00bdteaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "\u00bdteaspoon ground allspice",
    "\u00bdteaspoon ground cloves",
    "\u00bdcup heavy cream",
    "3tablespoons maple syrup",
    "Heaping 1 tablespoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal or about half as much Morton)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Get your oven to 400\u00b0F.",
    "Poke a few holes in the skins of the sweet potatoes, put on a baking sheet, and bake until they\u2019re nice and soft all the way through, about 1 hour.",
    "Meanwhile, peel, core, and cut the apples into \u00bd-inch pieces. In a medium pan over medium heat, cook the apples with 2 tablespoons of the butter until they turn golden brown and lose their crunch, about 20 minutes. Move the mixture to your food processor; add the cinnamon, allspice, and cloves; and set aside.",
    "When the sweet potatoes are done, combine the heavy cream, remaining 7 tablespoons butter, maple syrup, and salt in the medium pan over medium heat and warm, stirring occasionally, until the butter melts. Add the mixture to the food processor on top of the apples and buzz it all on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute.",
    "With a spoon, scoop the hot sweet potato flesh into the food processor; discard the skins. Buzz, stirring and scraping occasionally, until smooth. Taste and add more salt, if you want. Serve in something pretty.",
    "This will also keep in your fridge for 5 days or so."
