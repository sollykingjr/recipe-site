    "2. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Place chicken and \u00bc cup oil in 1-gallon zipper-lock freezer bag and toss to coat. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Gently lower bag into prepared water bath until chicken is fully submerged, and then clip top corner of bag to side of water bath container, allowing remaining air bubbles to rise to top of bag. Reopen 1 corner of zipper, release remaining air bubbles, and reseal bag. Cover and cook for at least 1\u00bd hours or up to 3 hours.",
    "3. Transfer chicken to paper towel\u2013lined plate and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Pat chicken thoroughly dry with paper towels. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place chicken skin side down in skillet and cook until skin is well browned and crisp, 4 to 6 minutes. Serve. (Chicken can be rapidly chilled in ice bath [see this page] and then refrigerated in zipper-lock bag after step 2 for up to 5 days. To reheat, return sealed bag to water bath set to 150 degrees for 20 minutes and then proceed with step 3.)"
