  "ingredients": [
    "3cups (720 g) kosher salt",
    "\u00bdcup (100 g) sugar",
    "1\u00bdteaspoons coriander seeds",
    "1\u00bdteaspoons whole black peppercorns",
    "\u00bcteaspoon ground turmeric",
    "\u00bcteaspoon sweet paprika",
    "About 15 lemons, washed and quartered lengthwise",
    "2bay leaves",
    "1cinnamon stick"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Mix the salt, sugar, coriander, peppercorns, turmeric, and paprika in a large bowl. Spread half the mixture over the bottom of a 1-gallon (4 L) glass jar with a tight-fitting lid.",
    "Put the lemon wedges in the jar, squeezing their juices into the jar as you throw them in. Pack the lemons tightly to remove all the air, which would cause them to oxidize. Add the bay leaves, cinnamon stick, and the remaining spice mixture and pour in just enough water to fill the jar to the rim. Seal and leave at room temperature for at least 2 months (3 months is even better), until the rinds are very soft. Every couple of weeks, flip the jar a couple of times to make sure all the flavors and spices are distributed evenly. To check for doneness, use a clean fork to remove one lemon wedge from the bottom part of the jar and make sure the rind is completely soft.",
    "Once the lemons are ready, move them to the fridge (this will slow down the pickling process), where they will keep for at least 6 months. To prevent spoilage, don\u2019t be tempted to remove the lemons from the jar with your fingers (even if you are convinced those fingers are clean)\u2014always use a clean, dry spoon, fork, or tongs. Give them a quick rinse and remove any seeds before using."
