    "2. Preheat the oven to 500 F.",
    "3. Heat the oil in a large roasting pan over two burners over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season the racks on both sides with salt and season on the top side with the rub. Place in the pan, rub-side down, and cook until golden brown and a crust has formed, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Remove the racks to a cutting board or baking sheet.",
    "4. Pour any excess oil out of the roasting pan and return to medium-high heat. Combine the soy sauce, 4 cups of water, and the ginger in the roasting pan and bring to a boil. Put a rack into the roasting pan and place the ribs on the rack. Brush with the peanut-chipotle puree.",
