  "directions": [
    "1. Make the salad: Place the romaine, fennel, and onion in an ice bath. Let sit for 5 minutes to crisp the lettuce and fennel and remove the onion\u2019s astringency.2. Remove the vegetables from the ice bath and dry in a salad spinner, or lay out on a kitchen towel to dry completely. You don\u2019t want a watery salad! Transfer to a large bowl along with the radishes and cucumbers. Set aside.3. Prepare the dressing: Add the olive oil, pecorino Romano, pepperoncini brine, honey, mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper to a jar, and shake until combined. Alternatively, whisk the ingredients in a small bowl.4. Add about half of the dressing to the lettuce mix, and toss to coat. Add more dressing as desired, and season with salt and pepper if needed. Transfer the salad to a large serving platter.5. Add the toppings: Top the salad with the tomatoes, peppers, artichokes, olives, prosciutto, provolone, soppressata, sliced pepperoncini, and basil. Serve any remaining dressing on the side for extra topping."
