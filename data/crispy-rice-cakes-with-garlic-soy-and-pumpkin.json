  "ingredients": [
    "4cups (24 ounces) Korean rice cake sticks, soaked in cold water for 30 minutes and drained well",
    "4cups peeled, sliced (3 inches by \u00be inch) kabocha",
    "\u00bccup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "1teaspoon kosher salt",
    "5garlic cloves, thinly sliced",
    "1cup Korean rice syrup, corn syrup, or maple syrup",
    "\u00bccup soy sauce",
    "2tablespoons granulated sugar",
    "1tablespoon aonori",
    "\u00bdteaspoon coarsely ground black pepper"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "PREHEAT the oven to 375\u00baF.",
    "COMBINE the rice cakes, kabocha, \u00bc cup of the oil, and the salt in a medium mixing bowl, stir to coat well, and transfer to one or two large sheet pans in a single layer.",
    "ROAST, rotating and switching the positions of the sheet pan halfway through, until the kabocha is tender and lightly browned and the rice cakes are crisp on the outside and soft and chewy inside, about 15 minutes.",
    "WHILE they roast, put the garlic and the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large wok, Dutch oven, or other wide high-sided pan, set it over high heat, and let the oil sizzle. Cook until the garlic is light golden, about 1 minute. Add the rice syrup, soy sauce, sugar, and \u00bd cup water and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring frequently, for 30 seconds. Take it off the heat and cover to keep warm.",
    "WHEN the rice cakes and pumpkin are done, transfer them to the wok. Turn the heat back to high, toss to coat well, and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens to glaze the rice cakes and kabocha, about 1 minute. The kabocha will break up a little, and that\u2019s just fine. Serve right away in bowls, sprinkled with the aonori and pepper."
