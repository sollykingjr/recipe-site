  "ingredients": [
    "Beet Butter",
    "1pound trimmed beets",
    "3tablespoons white sugar",
    "3tablespoons unsalted butter, softened",
    "\u00bdteaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal or about half as much Morton)",
    "\u00bdteaspoon vanilla extract",
    "For Serving",
    "1pint cookies \u2019n cream ice cream",
    "\u00bdcup well-stirred tahini",
    "Flaky sea salt"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "To make the beet butter: Get your oven to 350\u00b0F.",
    "Wrap the beets individually in foil if they\u2019re big boys, or wrap a few together if they\u2019re small or medium. Roast them on a baking sheet until you can easily pierce the center with a fork, 1\u00bd to 2 hours. Carefully unwrap and let them hang out until they\u2019re cool enough to handle.",
    "One by one, hold the beets in a paper towel and rub off and ditch the peels. Combine the beets, sugar, butter, kosher salt, and vanilla in a blender and buzz on high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute. If you need to, add a splash of water to help it blend.",
    "Pour the contents of the blender into a medium skillet, bring it to a steamy burble over medium heat, and cook, stirring pretty much constantly, for 10 minutes. It\u2019ll thicken up a bit. Let it cool and it\u2019s ready to use. It keeps in the fridge for up to 10 days.",
    "To serve: Scoop the ice cream into bowls (or just leave in the carton), drizzle on the tahini, spoon a couple of tablespoons of beet butter onto each bowl, and add a pinch of flaky salt. Eat."
