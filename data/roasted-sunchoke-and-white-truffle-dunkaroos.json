  "ingredients": [
    "Sunchokes",
    "2pounds sunchokes, scrubbed",
    "1tablespoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal or about half as much Morton)",
    "2tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "Dip",
    "12ounces (1\u00bd cups) Philadelphia cream cheese, room-temp so it\u2019s nice and soft",
    "3tablespoons La Rustichella white truffle pate",
    "1\u00bdteaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal or about half as much Morton), or more if you like",
    "1\u00bdteaspoons freshly ground black pepper",
    "\u00bdjuicy lemon, or more if you like"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "To roast the chokes: Get your oven to 400\u00b0F.",
    "While it\u2019s heating up, cut the sunchokes lengthwise in half (or if they\u2019re really big, slice them lengthwise into about \u00bd-inch-thick slices). Toss them with the salt and olive oil in a medium bowl.",
    "When the oven\u2019s preheated, scatter the sunchokes in a single layer onto one or two large baking sheets, cut-side down. Roast until brown and tender, not unlike a roasted chunk of potato, about 30 minutes.",
    "To make the dip: Meanwhile, buzz the cream cheese, truffle pate, salt, pepper, and about 1\u00bd tablespoons lemon juice in a food processor, occasionally stopping to swipe the sides with a rubber spatula and pulsing to break up the cream cheese blobs, until it\u2019s totally smooth, about 2 minutes. Season with more lemon juice and salt until you\u2019re happy.",
    "Serve the hot sunchokes with a bowl of the truffle stuff for dunking."
