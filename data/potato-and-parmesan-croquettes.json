  "ingredients": [
    "3large russet potatoes",
    "1cup grated Parmesan",
    "2eggs, lightly beaten",
    "salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "flour, for dusting",
    "1cup fine dried bread crumbs or instant polenta",
    "2cups olive or vegetable oil",
    "lemon wedges, to serve"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Scrub the potatoes, then cook them whole in a pan of well-salted boiling water until tender. Drain well. Once they are cool enough to handle, peel off the skin and then either grate them, press them through a potato ricer, or pass them through the largest holes of a food mill. Mix the potatoes with the Parmesan and one of the eggs and season with salt and pepper. Mold the potato mixture into 12 croquette shapes or cylinders, roll them in flour, then the other egg, roll them in the bread crumbs or polenta, and sit them on a plate lined with wax paper.",
    "Heat the oil to 375\u00b0F in a small shallow pan, or until a cube of bread takes about 40 seconds to turn golden. Fry the croquettes 3 or 4 at a time for about 2 minutes, or until they are golden all over. Use a slotted spoon to lift them out onto paper towels to drain the excess oil. Serve immediately with lemon wedges."
