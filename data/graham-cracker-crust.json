  "ingredients": [
    "6ounces (170g) plain graham crackers (9 or 10 sheets), broken into pieces",
    "2tablespoons demerara sugar",
    "\u00bdteaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt",
    "6tablespoons unsalted butter (3 oz / 85g), cut into pieces, at room temperature",
    "1large egg yolk (0.6 oz / 16g)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven: Arrange an oven rack in the center position and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
    "Make the crumb mixture: In a food processor, combine the graham crackers, demerara sugar, salt, butter, and egg yolk and process in long pulses until the crackers have broken down into fine crumbs and the mixture looks like moist sand. It should easily hold together when squeezed.",
    "Press the mixture into the pan: Transfer just shy of half the mixture to a 9-inch pie plate, 9-inch removable-bottom tart pan, or 9-inch springform pan. Push the mixture outward to create an even ring around the perimeter, then use a straight-sided 1-cup dry measure to press the mixture firmly against the sides. Scatter the remaining crumb mixture across the bottom of the pan and use the bottom of the measuring cup to flatten the crumbs into an even layer with no bare spots. Place the pie plate or pan on a foil-lined baking sheet.",
    "Bake the crust: Bake the crust until it\u2019s fragrant, firm to the touch, and the outer edges are darkened in color, 13 to 15 minutes."
