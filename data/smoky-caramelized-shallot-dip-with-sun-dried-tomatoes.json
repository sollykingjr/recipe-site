    "Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste",
    "1\u20444 cup (40 g) chopped olive oil\u2013packed sun-dried tomatoes",
    "1teaspoon sweet smoked paprika",
    "3\u20444 cup (180 g) labne or sour cream",
    "1\u20444 cup (60 g) Kewpie mayonnaise, or any mayo you have on hand",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat until the butter is melted, 2 minutes. Add the shallots, and season with a small pinch of salt.2. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring often, until deeply caramelized, 40 to 45 minutes. As the shallots cook, a fond (brown sticky stuff) will start to form on the bottom of the pan. I like to add small splashes of water during the cooking process when this happens and then scrape up the fond from the pan into the shallots.3. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and paprika. Cook just to toast the paprika slightly and incorporate the sun-dried tomatoes, about 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat, and let cool to room temperature.4. Mix the labne, mayonnaise, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and shallots in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour for flavors to meld.5. Top the dip with chives, and serve with your desired vehicles for dipping.6. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days."
