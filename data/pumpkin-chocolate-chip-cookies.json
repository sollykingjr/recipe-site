    "In a large bowl, stir together the almond or cashew butter, pumpkin puree, sugar and vanilla. Once the flax egg is ready, stir it in util a smooth mixture forms.",
    "In a separate bowl, add the almond flour, baking soda, salt and spices, then stir the dry mixture into the wet until a dough forms. Stir in the chocolate chips, leaving some for the tops of the cookies.",
    "Using a medium cookie scoop (about 1.5 tbsp) scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet about 2\u201d apart. You\u2019ll need to bake the cookies in two separate batches.",
    "Press down each cookie to about 1/2-3/4\u201d thickness, since they will not flatten on their own. Add a couple of chocolate chips to the tops of the cookies. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until set.",
