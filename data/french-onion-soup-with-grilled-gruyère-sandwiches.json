  "directions": [
    "1. Make the soup: Make a bouquet garni by tying the bay leaf and thyme sprigs together with kitchen twine (or skip this step and just throw the herbs directly into the pot with the onions in step 2, though you\u2019ll have to fish them out later).",
    "2. In a large heavy soup pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter over low heat. Stir in the onions and bouquet garni and cover the pot. Cook for 30 minutes, then uncover the pot and raise the heat to medium-high. Cook, saut\u00e9ing, until the onions are caramelized and golden, 25 to 35 minutes longer. If the onions start to burn, reduce the heat. You are looking for soft, evenly golden onions without dark brown spots.",
    "3. Stir in 1 teaspoon of the salt, the brandy, and Port (be careful, it may flame up). Scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot, and cook until the liquid has been absorbed, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove \u2153 cup of the cooked onions and reserve it for the sandwiches.",
    "4. Stir in 1 teaspoon of the salt, the brandy, and Port (be careful, it may flame up). Scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot, and cook until the liquid has been absorbed, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove \u2153 cup of the cooked onions and reserve it for the sandwiches.",
    "5. Make the grilled cheese: In the last 10 minutes of the soup\u2019s cooking time, butter both sides of each slice of bread. Then, if you are using it, spread the mustard over the butter on one side of each slice. Heap half of the reserved onions, and then half of the Gruy\u00e8re, on the mustard side of 2 bread pieces. Top with the remaining 2 pieces of bread (mustard side facing the cheese) and press down firmly with a spatula. The plain buttered sides should be on the outside of the sandwiches.",
    "6. Heat the 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. When the butter is hot, place both sandwiches in the skillet, cover, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the underside is golden. Flip them over and cook the other side for about another 3 minutes, until the bread is golden and the cheese is molten.",
    "7. To serve, ladle the soup into serving bowls and sprinkle each serving with parsley. Cut the sandwiches in fourths and serve them alongside the soup for dunking, or float the sandwiches on top of the soup."
