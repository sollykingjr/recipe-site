  "ingredients": [
    "2\u00bcteaspoons / 7g active dry yeast",
    "\u00bdcup / 120g warm water, between 95\u00b0 and 100\u00b0F",
    "2cups / 280g all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting",
    "\u00becup / 180g whole-milk yogurt",
    "1teaspoon / 3g Diamond Crystal kosher salt",
    "\u00bdteaspoon sugar",
    "Extra-virgin olive oil"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. In a large bowl, whisk together the yeast and warm water. Let this sit for 5 minutes until it begins to swell and get cloudy. Add the flour, yogurt, salt, and sugar and mix into a shaggy dough with your hands. Knead the dough in the bowl for 3 to 5 minutes, letting it smooth out into a ball. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.",
    "2. Transfer to a lightly floured surface, knead for another 2 minutes, and shape into a smooth, tight ball. Use a bench scraper to cut the dough into eight equal pieces. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let these pieces rest for another 20 to 30 minutes.",
    "3. Position a rack in the center of the oven and set the broiler to high.",
    "4. Dust the pieces with a bit more flour and roll them out into thin flatbreads, about \u00bc inch thick. Transfer the pieces to a large sheet pan and drizzle each side with olive oil. Rub oil all over the flatbreads to ensure they are evenly coated.",
    "5. Broil until puffed up and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the flatbreads and repeat. Broilers are finicky, so the first time you make this recipe, keep an eye on them, as the times may vary."
