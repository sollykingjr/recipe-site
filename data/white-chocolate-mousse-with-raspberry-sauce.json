    "1. Stir chocolate, egg yolks, and 2 tablespoons water together in medium glass bowl with rubber spatula. Set bowl over large saucepan of barely simmering water (water should not touch bottom of bowl) and cook, stirring and scraping sides of bowl constantly, until chocolate is just melted. (Once chocolate begins to melt, remove bowl from heat every 10 to 15 seconds so yolks don\u2019t overcook.)",
    "2. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, whip cream on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and whip until soft peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes.",
    "3. Gently whisk one-third of whipped cream into chocolate mixture until fully combined. Gently fold in remaining whipped cream with rubber spatula, making sure to scrape up any chocolate mixture from bottom of bowl, until no streaks remain.",
    "4. Distribute mousse evenly among four 6-ounce ramekins or serving glasses. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 2 days.",
    "5. About 1 hour before serving, combine raspberries, sugar, and lime juice in bowl. Let sit at room temperature until raspberries defrost; stir periodically to combine. (Raspberry sauce can be made simultaneously with mousse and allowed to thaw in refrigerator.)",
    "6. Spoon raspberry sauce over mousse. Serve."
