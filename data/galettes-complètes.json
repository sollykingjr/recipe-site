  "directions": [
    "1 For the cr\u00eapes: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over low heat for at least 5 minutes. While skillet heats, whisk buckwheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt together in medium bowl. In second bowl, whisk together milk and eggs. Add half of milk mixture to flour mixture and whisk until smooth. Add melted butter and whisk until incorporated. Whisk in remaining milk mixture until smooth.",
    "2 Using paper towel, wipe out skillet, leaving thin film of oil on bottom and sides. Increase heat to medium and let skillet heat for 1 minute. Test heat of skillet by placing 1 teaspoon batter in center and cooking for 20 seconds. If mini cr\u00eape is golden brown on bottom, skillet is properly heated; if it is too light or too dark, adjust heat accordingly and retest.",
    "3 Lift skillet off heat and pour \u2153 cup batter into far side of skillet; swirl gently in clockwise direction until batter evenly covers bottom of skillet, gently shaking skillet as needed. Return skillet to heat and cook cr\u00eape, without moving it, until top surface is dry and cr\u00eape starts to brown at edges, loosening cr\u00eape from sides of skillet with heat-resistant rubber spatula, about 35 seconds. Gently slide spatula underneath edge of cr\u00eape, grasp edge with your fingertips, and flip cr\u00eape. Cook until second side is lightly spotted, about 20 seconds. Transfer cr\u00eape to wire rack. Return skillet to heat for 10 seconds before repeating with remaining batter. As cr\u00eapes are done, stack on wire rack. (Cr\u00eapes can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 3 days or stacked between sheets of parchment paper and frozen for up to 1 month. Allow frozen cr\u00eapes to thaw completely in refrigerator before using.)",
    "4 For the filling: Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with vegetable oil spray. Arrange 4 cr\u00eapes spotty side down on prepared sheet (they will hang over edge). (Reserve remaining cr\u00eapes for another use.) Working with 1 cr\u00eape at a time, place 1 slice of ham in center of cr\u00eape, followed by \u2153 cup Gruy\u00e8re, covering ham evenly. Make small well in center of cheese. Crack 1 egg into well. Fold in the 4 sides to make a square, pressing to adhere.",
    "5 Brush cr\u00eape edges with melted butter and transfer sheet to oven. Bake until egg whites are uniformly set and yolks have filmed over but are still runny, 8 to 10 minutes. Using thin metal spatula, transfer each cr\u00eape to plate and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon chives. Serve immediately."
