    "\u2462 Cook the chicken:",
    "\u2726Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until just beginning to smoke. Place the chicken breasts skin-side down in the skillet and reduce the heat to medium. Cook, undisturbed, until the skin is golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Move the breasts around the pan if the chicken seems to be browning more quickly in some parts than others.",
    "\u2726Transfer to the oven (skin-side down). Roast until an instant-read thermometer registers 145\u00b0F when inserted into the thickest part of the breast, 25 to 30 minutes.",

Tilt the pan slightly toward you, let the melted butter collect at the side of the pan, and, using a large spoon, continuously baste the chicken breasts with the butter for 2 minutes. Need a quick butter-basting tutorial? See here. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board to rest, leaving the anchovy-garlic butter behind.",
