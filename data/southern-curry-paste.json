  "directions": [
    "1. Combine the guajillo, Thai chili, shallot, garlic, ginger, salt, turmeric, coriander, and cinnamon in the bowl of a food processor and process, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl several times, until a smooth paste forms, adding a few ice cubes if needed to help it blend more evenly. Scrape the paste into a bowl, use immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months.",
    "2. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the curry paste and cook, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes, until the paste deepens in color and becomes fragrant and the rawness of the shallot and garlic cooks out. Add the fish sauce, sugar, and tamarind paste and cook until the sugar melts.",
    "3. Whisk in the coconut milk, bring to a boil, and cook for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for about 30 minutes, until the sauce is reduced by half and is slightly thickened. Transfer to a bowl and let cool before use. This will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days."
