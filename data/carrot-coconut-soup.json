    "In a medium-large pot, heat the butter over medium heat. Once foamy and sliiiiiiiiiightly browned, add the onion, 1 teaspoon salt, and the pepper and cook, stirring, until the onion just begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the carrots and cook, stirring, until softened and the onion has turned deep golden, 18 to 20 minutes (some bits of the onion will turn a little darker than others\u2014it\u2019s cool).",
    "Add the chicken broth, coconut milk, lemongrass, and ginger. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to a very low simmer, cover (leave the lid open a crack), walk away for 40 minutes, and totally forget about the soup because your baby hit you on purpose for the first time.",
    "Stir in the sweet chili sauce, remove from the heat, and let cool slightly. Remove and discard the lemongrass. Blend the soup in the pot with a stick blender (or in a stand blender) until smooth. (If using a stand blender, hold the lid on tight and make sure to leave a little vent so steam can escape from the blender; protect your hand with an oven mitt or towel.) Season to taste with salt.",
    "Divide among bowls and top with chili oil and/or crispy shallots. Garnish with cilantro."
