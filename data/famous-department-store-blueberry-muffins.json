    "Tips from our Bakers",
    "Can you use coarse white sparkling sugar instead of granulated sugar on top of the muffins? Sure; but they won't be \"true\" Jordan Marsh muffins.",
    "If you use frozen berries, don't crush any of them. Rinse several times in cold water, then pat dry with paper towels before using; this will help prevent the muffins from baking up blue-green.",
    "Room-temperature butter is easier to work with than ice-cold butter when preparing muffin batter. If possible, remove butter from the fridge an hour or so before starting the recipe.",
