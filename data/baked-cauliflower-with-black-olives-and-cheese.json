  "directions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Oil a 9-by-13-inch (23 by 33 cm) baking pan with the 1 tablespoon olive oil.2. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add the cauliflower and cook until crisp-tender but not at all mushy, about 5 minutes. Drain well, then spread the cauliflower in the prepared baking pan.3. In a medium skillet, cook the onion in \u00bc cup (60 ml) of the olive oil over medium heat, stirring often, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and scatter the onions over the cauliflower florets. Season lightly with salt and pepper, keeping in mind that the olives and the cheese will add quite a bit of saltiness.4. Drape the sliced cheese over the cauliflower, then scatter the olives on top. Drizzle the remaining \u00bc cup (60 ml) olive oil over everything.5. Bake until the top is nice and golden, 20 to 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature."
