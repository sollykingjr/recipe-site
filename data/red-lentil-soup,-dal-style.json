  "directions": [
    "In a large pot, heat the neutral oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering, then add the onion, ginger, garlic, and any fresh chile you are using, and cook, stirring, until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn the heat to medium-low, and add the turmeric, cumin, coriander, cayenne (if you\u2019re not using fresh chile), and salt. Cook the onion mixture for a minute or two, then add the tomatoes, and scrape up any bits that have stuck to the pan. Add the carrot, cook for 1 minute more, then add the water and lentils. Bring back to a simmer, partially cover, and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, until the lentils and carrot are soft. Taste, and adjust the seasonings as needed. If desired, blend for a second or two with an immersion blender to create a mixed smooth-rough texture.",
    "Heat the canola oil in a small skillet over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke, add the mustard seeds and cover the pan with a lid or splatter screen. When the seeds stop popping, immediately pour the oil over the soup. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and garnish with cilantro."
