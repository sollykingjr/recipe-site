  "ingredients": [
    "1large carrot",
    "1large celery stalk",
    "10(\u215b-inch or so) slices of beef (rump or chuck are ideal)",
    "salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "2(14.5-ounce) cans plum tomatoes",
    "3tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "\u00bdcup white wine or red wine"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Cut the carrot and celery into extremely thin batons that are roughly the same length as the beef slices are wide. Take a slice of beef, lay it flat on your work surface, and season it with salt and pepper. Place a bundle of carrot and celery at the bottom of each beef slice and roll the beef around the batons, tucking the sides in if you can, until you have a neat cylinder. Secure the roll with a toothpick along its length.",
    "Coarsely chop the tomatoes or pass them through a food mill. Warm the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed frying or saut\u00e9 pan. Add the beef rolls and cook them, turning as needed, until browned on all sides, which will take about 6 minutes. Add the wine to the pan and increase the heat until the wine sizzles and evaporates. Add the tomatoes and stir and nudge the rolls so that they are evenly spaced and well coated. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the rolls, partly covered, stirring gently and turning them a couple of times, until the meat is cooked through and tender. This will take 1\u00bd\u20132 hours. Add a little more wine or water if the sauce seems to be drying out too much during the cooking. Let the rolls rest for at least 15 minutes before serving with a spoonful of sauce."
