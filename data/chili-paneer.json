  "directions": [
    "1. To make the batter: In a medium bowl, combine the cornstarch, flour, salt, and roasted Sichuan pepper. Pour in the water and whisk to form a smooth batter, adding more water as needed to keep the consistency smooth.",
    "2. To make the sauce: In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce, chili crisp, tomato paste, vinegar, sugar, and sesame seeds together. Set aside.",
    "3. In a large nonstick pan over medium heat, warm the oil. Dip the paneer cubes in the batter and immediately transfer to the pan, frying and turning the cubes until the cheese is evenly golden brown on each side, 2 to 3 minutes. When all the cubes have been fried, pour the sauce into the pan and stir-fry for about 2 minutes to coat the paneer. The sauce should reduce a bit and shine and glisten.",
    "4. Remove the pan from the heat, transfer the paneer and sauce to a serving bowl, and top with the scallions."
