    "2large egg yolks",
    "2teaspoons fresh lemon juice, plus more as necessary",
    "Kosher salt",
    "\u00bdcup olive oil",
    "\u00bdcup grapeseed or vegetable oil",
    "1small garlic clove, finely grated (optional)",
    "1tablespoon finely grated lemon zest (optional)",
    ""
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Whisk the egg yolks, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt together in a medium bowl (one that is deeper than it is wide, if possible\u2014it\u2019s easier to emulsify everything together when it\u2019s concentrated in one area). Combine both oils together in a measuring cup with a spout.",
    "2 In a slow, steady stream, add the oil mixture to the egg mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking all along, making sure whatever you\u2019ve added is completely incorporated before whisking more oil in. Continue with all the oil, thinning with water or lemon juice as needed to keep the future aioli from becoming too thick. (The ideal thickness is extremely personal, but when you know, you know.)",
    "3 Whisk in the garlic and lemon zest, if using, and season with more salt and lemon juice as desired."
