  "ingredients": [
    "2x 4-oz boneless, skinless chicken breasts",
    "2thick slices of whole-wheat bread with seeds (2\u00bd oz each)",
    "1clove of garlic",
    "1lemon",
    "1\u00beoz arugula"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Place the chicken breasts between two large sheets of parchment paper, and whack with the base of a large non-stick frying pan to flatten them to about \u00bd inch thick. Tear the bread into a food processor, then peel, chop, and add the garlic, and blitz into fairly fine crumbs. Pour the crumbs over the chicken, roughly pat onto each side, then re-cover with the paper and whack again, to hammer the crumbs into the chicken and flatten them further.",
    "Put the pan on a medium heat. Fry the crumbed chicken in 1 tablespoon of olive oil for 3 minutes on each side, or until crisp, golden, and cooked through. Slice, plate up, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, sprinkle with lemon-dressed arugula, and serve with lemon wedges, for squeezing over."
