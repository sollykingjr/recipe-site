    "WHEN the oil is hot enough, fry the rice in three batches. Add the first batch and fry until the rice puffs and turns golden brown, 15 to 30 seconds per batch. Use a fine-mesh strainer to transfer each batch to the paper towels and spread them out a bit. Let the rice sit on the paper towels for at least 15 minutes to drain excess oil.",
