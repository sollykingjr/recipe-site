  "ingredients": [
    "Rag\u00f9",
    "42g / 3 Tbsp olive oil",
    "Black pepper, q.b.",
    "624g / 1 lb 6 oz extruded spaghetti (this page)",
    "180g / 2 cups finely grated pecorino romano"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 - Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Generously salt the water.",
    "2 - Place a large saut\u00e9 pan over low heat. Add the olive oil and pepper, using about 90 turns of the grinder, along with 3 ladles (170g / \u00be cup) pasta cooking water. This will bloom the pepper and extract more of its flavor.",
    "3 - Add the spaghetti to the water and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, until al dente.",
    "4 - Using tongs or a pasta basket, remove the pasta from the pot and transfer to the saut\u00e9 pan. Quickly toss to combine.",
    "5 - Remove from the heat. Gradually add 160g / 1\u00be cups of the pecorino while tossing to combine. As the mixture tightens up from the cheese, alternate sprinkling in some of the remaining cheese and pasta cooking water until you have a smooth, silky sauce that evenly coats the pasta and glides in the pan. It is essential that the pasta water and cheese balance each other out: if you have too much water, the sauce will be soupy; too little and it will have the texture of a dry paste. You want yours to glisten and cling.",
    "6 - Divide the pasta into bowls and garnish with the remaining pecorino and with pepper q.b."
