  "ingredients": [
    "1lemon",
    "1orange",
    "\u00bdcup olive oil",
    "4whole chiles de arbol, or \u00bd teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes",
    "Peel of 1 grapefruit",
    "1pound unpitted Castelvetrano olives"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Halve and thinly slice one half of each lemon and orange, saving the other halves for juicing.",
    "2 Warm the olive oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add the chiles, lemon and orange slices, and grapefruit peel. Let sizzle a minute or two, then add the olives.",
    "3 Reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting and let the olives hang out here for anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour, stirring every so often. (If your stove\u2019s burner is one of those that never quite gets that low, then you might want to max them out around 30 minutes.)",
    "4 Let the olives cool to room temperature in the pot and then squeeze in the lemon and orange juice from the remaining halves. Serve with citrus peels and all, making sure you have a little dish for the olive pits."
