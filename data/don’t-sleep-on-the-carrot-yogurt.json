  "ingredients": [
    "Carrot Puree",
    "2cups sliced (about \u00bd inch) carrots",
    "2tablespoons maple syrup",
    "1teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal or about half as much Morton)",
    "For the Dish",
    "4cups whole-milk Greek yogurt (or whatever you fuck with)",
    "2 to 4cups Nini\u2019s Granola or your favorite one",
    "1cup or so blueberries (or whatever berries are ripe)",
    "2tangerines, clementines, or satsumas, peeled and separated into segments",
    "Handful of mint leaves, torn",
    "1lemon, for zesting",
    "Heaping 4 tablespoons Liz\u2019s Carrot Marmalade or honey"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "To make the carrot puree: Put the carrots in a medium pot, cover with an inch of water, and get it boiling over high heat. Lower the heat and cook at a rolling simmer until the carrots are poke-a-finger-through-them tender, about 1 hour. Use a slotted spoon to move the carrots to your blender, but don\u2019t ditch the water yet.",
    "Add the maple syrup, salt, and just enough of the cooking water to get the blender moving (about 3 tablespoons). Blend on high speed until totally smooth, about 1 minute. Let it cool and chill it in the fridge, where it\u2019ll keep in an airtight container for up to a week.",
    "To assemble the dish: Plop the yogurt in bowls, add some or all of the carrot puree, and use a spoon to swirl it all around so it looks cool. Top each with \u00bd to 1 cup of the granola, some berries, citrus segments, and mint leaves. Zest the lemon over all the stuff and spoon the carrot marmalade over each bowl. It\u2019s ready to go."
