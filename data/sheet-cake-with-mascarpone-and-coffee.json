    "1 Make the cream. Using a stand mixer or an electric hand beater, in a medium bowl, whip the egg yolks and \u00bc cup sugar until very pale yellow, tripled in volume, and holds a slight ribbon when the beaters are lifted. Transfer to a large bowl.2 Whip the cream, a pinch of salt, the vanilla bean, if using, and the remaining \u00bc cup sugar in the mixer bowl until you\u2019ve got soft peaks. Add the mascarpone and continue to whip until you\u2019ve got a soft, pillowy mixture with medium peaks.3 Assemble. Combine the espresso and rum in a small bowl. Using a sifter or powdered sugar shaker, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the cocoa powder.4 Place half of the cake (or a layer of ladyfingers) in the bottom of the baking dish and, using a spoon or pastry brush, douse with half the espresso mixture. Evenly spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the cake, and repeat with the remaining cake, espresso, and mascarpone mixtures. Dust the top layer with the remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder. Chill for at least 4 hours before serving."
