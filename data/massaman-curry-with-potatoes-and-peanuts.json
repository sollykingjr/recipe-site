  "directions": [
    "1. For the curry paste Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange New Mexican chiles on prepared sheet and toast until puffed and fragrant, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer chiles to large plate. Heat broiler.",
    "2. Place shallots and garlic on now-empty sheet and broil until softened and skins are charred, 6 to 9 minutes.",
    "3. When cool enough to handle, stem and seed chiles and tear into 1\u00bd-inch pieces. Process chiles in blender until finely ground, about 1 minute. Peel shallots and garlic. Add shallots, garlic, ginger, water, lime juice, oil, fish sauce, five-spice powder, cumin, and pepper to blender. Process to smooth paste, 2 to 3 minutes, scraping down sides of blender jar as needed. (You should have 1 cup paste. Paste can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 2 months; if frozen, let thaw completely before using.)",
    "4. For the curry Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add curry paste and cook, stirring constantly, until paste begins to brown, 2\u00bd to 3 minutes. Stir in coconut milk, broth, potatoes, onion, peanuts, and salt, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to simmer and cook until potatoes are just tender, 12 to 14 minutes.",
    "5. Stir in chicken; continue to simmer until chicken is cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Off heat, stir in lime zest. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve."
