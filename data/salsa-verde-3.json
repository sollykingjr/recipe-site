  "ingredients": [
    "1pound fresh tomatillos, husks removed",
    "1serrano pepper (or 2 jalape\u00f1o peppers), stem removed",
    "2cloves garlic, peeled",
    "1/2cup fresh cilantro leaves",
    "1/3cup diced white onion",
    "1tablespoon lime juice",
    "1teaspoon Kosher salt, or more to taste",
    "1/4teaspoon ground cumin (optional)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F.",
    "Rinse and dry the tomatillos. Then spread the tomatillos out evenly on a baking sheet (I recommend lining it with foil for easy cleanup), along with the serrano pepper. Roast in the oven for 15 minutes, or until the tomatillos start to brown on top and are cooked through.",
    "Remove from the oven, and transfer the tomatillos and serrano pepper to a blender or food processor. Add the garlic, cilantro, onion, lime juice, salt, and cumin (if using) to the blender or food processor, and pulse the mixture until it reaches your desired consistency. (Always be careful when blending hot mixtures, as they expand while blending.) Taste and season with extra salt and/or cilantro if needed.",
    "Serve immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 5 days.",
    "*To make this salsa more spicy, I recommend adding in an extra serrano pepper or two. Or to make it less spicy, omit the serranos entirely (or use a jalape\u00f1o, which has slightly less heat). You can also always core chile peppers (remove the seeds) to reduce the heat.",
    "*If the salsa is too thick, feel free to add in 1/4 to 1/3 cup of water (or chicken/vegetable stock)."
