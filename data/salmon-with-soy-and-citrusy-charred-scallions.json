  "directions": [
    "1 Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Thinly slice 4 scallions and place in a medium bowl; set aside.2 Place the salmon skin side down in a large baking dish and drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and lots of pepper. Place in the oven and roast until the center begins to turn from deep sunset orange to salmon-y pink, but still remains pretty medium-rare toward the top, 10 to 12 minutes.3 Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat in a medium cast-iron skillet. Add the remaining scallions and season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until deeply charred in spots, 4 to 6 minutes.4 Transfer the scallions to a cutting board and coarsely chop. Add to the bowl with raw scallions along with the soy sauce, lemon zest and juice, orange juice, and remaining \u00bc cup olive oil; season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes.5 Using a large spatula, transfer the salmon to a large serving platter, leaving any skin behind. Spoon a bit of the charred scallion mixture over, serving any extra alongside."
