  "directions": [
    "1. In a medium pot over high heat, bring water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook according to the package instructions. I like mine cooked through but slightly al dente. Drain the noodles in a colander and rinse under cold water to stop them from cooking further. Set aside.",
    "2. To make the sauce: Place the pickled mustard stems, celery, garlic, ginger, chili crisp, vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, salt, white pepper, and roasted Sichuan pepper in a large bowl and mix well. Divide the sauce between two serving bowls.",
    "3. In a small pot over high heat, bring the stock to a boil. Blanch the bean sprouts in the broth until they start to appear translucent, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the sprouts to the two serving bowls. Using tongs or chopsticks, divide the cooled noodles between the two bowls.",
    "4. Remove the boiling stock from the heat and pour it evenly into the noodle bowls. Top with the peanuts, scallions, and cilantro."
