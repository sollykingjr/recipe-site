  "ingredients": [
    "about 1\u00bc pounds potatoes",
    "3tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "salt",
    "1mild onion",
    "6large eggs",
    "freshly ground black pepper",
    "butter, for cooking"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Slice the potatoes into \u215b-inch-thick rounds. Warm the olive oil over medium heat in a nonstick or cast-iron frying pan, add the potatoes and a pinch of salt, then stir until each round is well coated with oil. Cover the pan and cook over low heat for 10 minutes.",
    "Thinly slice the onion. Uncover the pan, by which time the potatoes should be softening, and add the onion. Stir, re-cover the pan, and cook for another 10 minutes. Uncover the pan, stir, and keep cooking until the onions and potatoes are very soft and collapsing. Remove the pan from the heat.",
    "In a large bowl, beat the eggs lightly and season well with salt and pepper. Add the potatoes and onion to the eggs and stir well. Return the pan to medium heat, add a dot of butter, and allow it to coat the pan. Pour in the egg, potato, and onion mixture and even it out with a fork. Cook for about 20 minutes over gentle heat, using a wooden spatula to ease the frittata away from the sides as it starts to set. Once it is almost set and still just a little wet on top, invert it upside down onto a plate and slide it back in the pan for another minute. Invert it back onto a serving plate. Wait at least 10 minutes (and up to a few hours) before eating."
