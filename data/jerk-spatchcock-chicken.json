  "directions": [
    "PREHEAT THE OVEN",
    "Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC.",
    "PREPARE THE RUB",
    "Peel and mince the garlic. Finely chop the chilli. Throw the jerk seasoning, allspice, honey, tomato pur\u00e9e, garlic, chilli and olive oil into a bowl and mix well.",
    "SPATCHCOCK THE CHICKEN",
    "Lay out the chicken onto the chopping board, breast side down. Use a large knife or sharp pair of scissors to firmly cut down either side of the backbone, then pull it out at the remaining joint and away from the bird. Turn the bird over and you should now be able to flatten it on the board.",
    "JERK THE CHICKEN",
    "Save 3 tablespoons of the jerk mix then run the rest all over and inside the chicken. Poke several holes in the meat with a skewer to help the flavour penetrate the bird as it cooks. Season the chicken with the zest of the limes (then save the limes), salt and pepper.",
    "START COOKING THE CHICKEN",
    "Preheat a frying pan over a medium heat, then add the butter and let it melt and foam. Place the chicken into the pan, breast side down, and leave it to cook for a few minutes, until the skin is starting to blacken. Turn the chicken over and cook for another 10 minutes over a medium heat.",
    "COOK THE RICE AND CHICKEN",
    "Wash the rice under running water until it runs clear and scatter the rice and drained kidney beans into a deep baking dish. Pour over the chicken stock, coconut milk and the saved jerk mix then stir everything together. Put a wire rack over the top of the baking dish. Lay out the chicken over the wire rack so that the juices drip into the rice. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 30-40 minutes to finish cooking the chicken and to let the rice absorb all of the liquid. Check the chicken is cooked by poking a skewer into the thickest part and making sure the juices run clear.",
    "REST AND SERVE",
    "Leave to rest for 15 minutes once cooked, then fluff up the rice with a fork and serve the two together. Quarter the lime and slice the red chilli to garnish and dig in! Serves 4"
