    "1cup (240 ml) white vinegar",
    "\u00bdcup (100 g) granulated sugar",
    "2tablespoons dry mustard",
    "1tablespoon turmeric",
    "1tablespoon kosher salt",
    "\u00bdcup (65 g) cornstarch"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "In a large pot, place the onions, cauliflower, and cucumbers. Add the vinegar, sugar, dry mustard, turmeric, and salt. Simmer gently until tender, about 15 minutes.Turn off the heat. In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch with about 2 tablespoons water to make a slurry, then whisk the slurry into the vinegar mixture. While the mixture is hot, pour it into the Mason jars, cap them, and listen for the doink\u201d when the cap is pulled in by the cooling of the pickles. After about 15 minutes, test the tops with a gentle push to make sure they are sucked in. Don\u2019t worry: For any that aren\u2019t, you can refrigerate, or you can reheat and re-cap. Store your pickles in a cool, dry, dark place; there\u2019s no need to refrigerate until opened.",
