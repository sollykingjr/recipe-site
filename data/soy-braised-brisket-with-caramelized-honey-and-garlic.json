  "directions": [
    "1 Season the brisket with salt and pepper. Do this as far ahead as possible (somewhere between 5 minutes and 48 hours is great).2 Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed Dutch oven (make sure it\u2019s got a fitted lid) over medium-high heat. Add the brisket, fattiest side down (if there is not a clear winner, any side will do) and sear, occasionally pressing with tongs to ensure even contact with the pot, until it\u2019s deeply golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Flip the brisket and sear on the other side until similarly, deeply, golden brown. Sometimes a brisket will have a third (or even fourth) side, depending on the shape and cut, so sear on all sides if applicable.3 Transfer the brisket to a plate or platter and drain the pot of any residual fat into a heatproof container (no need to wipe it out). Return the pot to medium-high heat and add the honey. Let it sizzle and bubble and start to caramelize, about 2 minutes. (If the pot is dark and you can\u2019t see it, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll smell it. It will smell like a rich, deep caramel.)4 Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the garlic, onion, cinnamon, star anise, ginger, chiles, and bay leaves. Stir to coat in the caramelized honey and cook until they take on some color and soften a bit, 2 to 3 minutes.5 Add the beef broth, soy sauce, vinegar, and fish sauce. Return the brisket to the pot, nestling it in there. If the brisket is not at least three-fourths covered, add more broth or water until it is.6 Bring the liquid to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cover. Simmer gently, peeking only when you absolutely can\u2019t stand how good it smells and need to check on it to make sure it\u2019s not ready (it\u2019s not), until it\u2019s totally, completely, impossibly tender, 3 to 3\u00bd hours.7 Using tongs or two spatulas, remove the brisket and transfer to a cutting board, reserving the braising liquid. If you like, use a slotted spoon or strainer to remove and discard the vegetables and spices from the pot (this is unnecessary, but a nice touch if you don\u2019t want to fish them out later).8 Slice the brisket and return it to the pot with the liquid (you can also shred it, if that is your preference).9 Toss the herbs and chives together in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper.10 Serve brisket out of the pot or inside a shallow bowl, ladling some of the braising liquid over. Top with herbs and maybe a pinch of red pepper flakes. Serve with additional braising liquid for spooning over or drinking, and with rice noodles or rice, if you like."
