    "1cup (240 ml) best-quality raw tahini",
    "\u00bccup (60 ml) fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste",
    "Ice water",
    "\u00bdteaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed",
    "1small garlic clove, grated or minced"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Pour the raw tahini into a medium bowl and add the lemon juice. Mix with a fork or a whisk until the color turns a shade lighter. The texture may become weird and lumpy; don\u2019t worry, this is part of the process.",
    "Gradually whisk in about \u00bd cup (120 ml) ice water. The sauce should turn smooth, velvety, and almost white. The \u00bd cup (120 ml) water will make a thick dip; whisk in another \u00bc cup (60 ml) or so to make a thinner sauce, if you\u2019d like. Keep tinkering with water, lemon juice, and tahini until you get a consistency and flavor you like.",
    "Whisk in the salt and garlic; taste and adjust your seasonings."
