  "ingredients": [
    "1lemon",
    "2pounds skin-on or skinless salmon fillet",
    "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "6tablespoons (\u00be stick) unsalted butter",
    "\u00bccup olive oil, plus more for drizzling",
    "\u00bdsmall red onion, very thinly sliced into rings, divided",
    "2tablespoons brined capers, drained",
    "1cup fresh dill",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Thinly slice half the lemon and remove any seeds; save the other half for juicing.2 Place the salmon on a rimmed baking sheet or in a large baking dish and season with salt and pepper.3 Heat the butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, swirling occasionally until the butter has started to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the olive oil, sliced lemon, and half the onion. Season with salt and pepper and cook, tossing occasionally, until the lemons and onion have started to brown and frizzle (you\u2019re looking for kind of crisped, rather than softened and caramelized), 2 to 3 minutes. Add the capers.4 Pour the browned butter\u2013lemon mixture over the salmon. Place it in the oven and roast until just cooked through but still medium-rare on the inside (it will look more translucent, less opaque), 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven.5 Meanwhile, toss together the dill and sesame seeds, if using, in a medium bowl and give a squeeze from the halved lemon; season with salt and pepper. Scatter on top of the salmon along with the remaining sliced onion."
