  "directions": [
    "to make the hazelnut cream in a food processor Combine \u00be cup of the hazelnuts\u2014reserve remainder for garnish\u2014the salt, and the sugar in a food processor, and grind as finely as possible. Add butter, and blend until combined, scraping down the sides if needed. Add the egg and extract or flavoring; blend until combined. Transfer to a bowl, and chill until firm but spreadable.",
    "to make the cream without a food processor Mince \u00be cup hazelnuts to a fine powder and mix with sugar and salt. Whisk butter with the hazelnut-sugar mixture, egg, and flavoring until combined. Chill until firm but spreadable.",
    "make the syrup Combine the water, sugar, and orange peels in a small saucepan, and bring to a simmer. Stirring frequently, simmer until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool slightly, then fish out and discard the peels and add any liqueur or flavoring.",
    "Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Place an oven-safe cooling rack on a baking sheet and arrange the brioche slices in one layer.",
    "Generously brush each slice with the syrup. Divide the raspberries among slices of brioche and mash them roughly, unevenly, into the syrup-soaked bread. Dollop each slice with equal amounts of hazelnut cream, and use a small offset spatula or butter knife to spread it evenly over each surface. Don\u2019t worry if it makes a mess of the raspberries already mashed on\u2014that\u2019s the point! Coarsely chop the remaining hazelnuts, and sprinkle some over each slice.",
    "Bake the brioche for 10 to 15 minutes, until puffed and golden all over. Remove from the oven, and dust with powdered sugar. Eat warm or at room temperature."
