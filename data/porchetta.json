    "salt",
    "1teaspoon black peppercorns, crushed",

    "2tablespoons chopped rosemary",
    "2garlic cloves, finely chopped",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "Bear in mind that the porchetta needs to rest, once seasoned, for at least 12 hours, and then come back to room temperature before roasting.",
    "Place the pork skin-side down on a clean work surface, season it generously with salt, then massage the salt into the flesh with your fingertips. Sprinkle over the black pepper, red pepper flakes, rosemary, garlic, and fennel. If you are using a loin, place it about 2 inches from one end. Roll the porchetta up as neatly and tightly as possible. Tie it at \u00be-inch intervals with kitchen twine. Prick it all over with a trussing needle or the tip of a very sharp knife. Cover the pork, first with wax paper, then with foil, and leave it to rest for at least 12 hours in the fridge.",
    "Remove it from the fridge at least 1 hour before roasting and preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. Use a clean, dry dish cloth to pat the meat very dry and put it on a rack over a large baking sheet. Slide the pork into the middle of the oven and roast for 4\u00bd hours. For the last half an hour, crank the oven up to maximum to crisp the skin, so that it almost ruptures into deep golden crackling. The meat inside will be soft and succulent. Leave the meat to rest, uncovered, for at least half an hour before eating."
