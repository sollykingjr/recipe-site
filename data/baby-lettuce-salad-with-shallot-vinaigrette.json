  "directions": [
    "1. Clean the greens: Rinse the leaves in cold water. Spin them dry in a salad spinner or let them air-dry, spread out over a towel, and pat them with paper towels.",
    "2. Prepare the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together the shallot, lemon juice, and mustard. Add the salt and pepper and whisk again to dissolve the salt. Continue whisking while adding the oil in a slow stream. (Working slowly will give you a smooth and emulsified dressing.) Taste as you go, adding more salt and pepper and/or lemon juice or vinegar to balance the flavors. You can also do the whole process in a lidded jar, shaking the contents instead of whisking them (add the oil \u2153 cup at a time for this method, shaking vigorously after each addition). The jar technique makes it easy to store any excess dressing.",
    "3. Place your greens in a large serving bowl. Just before you are ready to serve the salad, dress it (if you let the dressed salad sit for too long, the greens will become droopy). Drizzle the dressing over the greens a little at a time, tossing the leaves with your hands until they are just coated, or you can use salad tossers or tongs if you prefer. (You probably won\u2019t use all of the dressing.) Serve immediately."
