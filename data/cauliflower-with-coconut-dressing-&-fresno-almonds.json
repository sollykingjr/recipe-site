    "1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 450\u00b0F.",
    "2. Cut the cauliflower into cherry-size florets and spread them out on an unlined sheet pan. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with a few big pinches of salt.",
    "3. Roast for 15 minutes, then give the pan a shake to flip the florets. Roast until the cauliflower has browned and crisped on the edges, another 10 to 15 minutes; don\u2019t be afraid to go dark.",
    "4. Meanwhile, finely dice half of the Fresno pepper and add it to a small bowl. Cut the other half into thin slices and set aside.",
    "5. To the bowl with the diced Fresno pepper, add the garlic, lime zest and juice, coconut milk, 5 finely chopped mint leaves, 1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro, the sugar, and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Whisk this together and chill the dressing in the fridge while the cauliflower finishes roasting.",
    "6. Set a small pan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the thinly sliced Fresno pepper and swirl, letting the oil simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the almonds and let them toast in the oil until fragrant, another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and season with salt.",
    "7. When the cauliflower is out of the oven, let it cool for a few minutes before adding it to a large bowl. Pour in the dressing and give it a few mixes. Add the cherries and almond\u2013Fresno pepper mixture. Tear in the remaining mint and cilantro. Pile onto a big plate and serve."
