  "ingredients": [
    "FOR THE SAUCE",
    "- 2 cups blueberries",
    "- \u00bd cup granulated sugar",
    "- 1 lemon",
    "FOR THE DISH",
    "- 4 ripe bananas, unpeeled",
    "- \u00bc cup roughly chopped raw walnuts"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "MAKE THE SAUCE:- COMBINE the blueberries and sugar in a medium saucepan. Stir in the finely grated zest and juice from half of the lemon. Save the rest for another purpose.- BRING the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to cook at a simmer until some blueberries burst and the sauce thickens to a slightly syrupy texture, about 10 minutes. Let it cool completely.",
    "MAKE THE DISH:- RIGHT before you serve, set two stovetop burners to medium-high and roast the bananas directly over the flame, rotating and turning them over to cook them evenly, until the bananas are completely blackened all over, about 5 minutes. I like to use wire racks set over the flame, because it makes it easier to evenly blacken, though the racks will warp and discolor.- TO serve, use tongs (the bananas will be hot) to remove the peel alongside one side of each banana to reveal the flesh and put them flesh-side up on plates. Spoon on the blueberry sauce, sprinkle on the walnuts, and serve."
