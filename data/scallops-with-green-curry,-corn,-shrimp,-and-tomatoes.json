  "directions": [
    "1. Prepare the green curry sauce: Combine 2 cans of the coconut milk and the basil in a blender and blend until smooth.",
    "2. Heat the oil and remaining \u00bd cup coconut milk in a medium saucepan over high heat until the mixture begins to shimmer. Add the curry paste and cook, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes, until it begins to deepen in color and becomes fragrant, stirring constantly so that it does not burn, about 5 minutes longer, until it begins to look curdled. Deglaze with the fish sauce and palm sugar, and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.",
    "3. Add the basil\u2013and\u2013coconut milk mixture, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the kaffir lime leaves and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, until the flavors have melded and the sauce has reduced slightly. Season with lime juice to taste. Remove from the heat, cover, and keep warm while you prepare the rest of the dish.",
    "4. Prepare the scallops: Season the scallops on both sides with salt. Heat \u00bc cup of the oil in a large nonstick pan over high heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Add the scallops and cook for about 2 minutes, until the bottoms are golden brown and the scallops are cooked about three-quarters of the way. Turn the scallops over and cook for 30 seconds longer. Remove the scallops to a plate.",
    "5. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil to the pan and heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the corn and press into a single layer and cook for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is golden brown and slightly charred. Turn over and cook until the other side is golden brown and charred, 2 minutes longer.",
    "6. Stir in the shrimp and cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and snap peas and cook, stirring a few times until just warmed through, about 3 minutes longer. Add lime juice to taste and season with salt.",
    "7. To serve: Ladle some of the green curry sauce onto a plate, top with some of the vegetable mixture, then top that mixture with 4 scallops. Drizzle some of the coconut cream over and garnish with cilantro leaves and the remaining 2 kaffir lime leaves. Serve with rice."
