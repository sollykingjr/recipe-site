  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. In a wok or frying pan over high heat, add the oil and heat until smoking. Add the chilies and Sichuan pepper and fry quickly so they don\u2019t burn, 10 to 20 seconds. Add the ginger, garlic, and scallions and fry until fragrant. Add the celery and shrimp and flash-fry for about 3 minutes, until the shrimp start to turn pink.",
    "2. Pour in the sauce, stirring to make sure it coats all the ingredients evenly for 1 minute. The sauce will thicken as soon as it hits the heat, so move quickly here. Stir in the cashews at the very end before transferring to a serving platter.",
    "3. Garnish with the microgreens (if using) and serve immediately with rice."
