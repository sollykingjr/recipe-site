  "directions": [
    "COMBINE the gochugaru, cayenne, cloves, cardamom, and star anise in a large heatproof mixing bowl and mix well.",
    "IN a medium pot, heat the oil over high heat, stirring occasionally, until it registers 275\u00baF on a thermometer. Immediately pour it over the spice mixture and let it all sit until completely cool, about 1 hour. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, discarding the solids.
