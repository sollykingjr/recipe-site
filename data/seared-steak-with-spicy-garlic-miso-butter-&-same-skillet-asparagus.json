  "ingredients": [
    "FOR THE STEAK",
    "1pound boneless rib eye steak (about 1\u00bc inches thick), NOT trimmed of excess fat",
    "1teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste",
    "\u00bdteaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste",
    "1tablespoon butter",
    "1clove garlic, finely minced",
    "\u00bepound asparagus, tough bottoms snapped off (see this page), cut into 2-inch lengths",
    "1cup low-sodium chicken broth",
    "\u00bccup Spicy Garlic-Miso Butter (recipe follows), or more to taste"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Heat a 9-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until screaming hot, 6 to 7 minutes. Pat the steak dry with paper towels and season both sides with the salt and pepper. Lay the steak in the pan and DFWI (remember? Don\u2019t. F*ck. With. It.). Leave the steak alone for 5 minutes, then flip and DFWI again, another 4 to 5 minutes for medium-rare (longer if you like it more cooked, less if you like it less cooked, but you know that already). Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let it rest.",
    "Pour all but 1 tablespoon of the steak grease out of the pan and return the pan to medium heat. Add the butter, melt it (this happens fast), add the garlic, and cook it until golden, about 30 seconds. Add the asparagus and chicken broth and cook, stirring once in a while, until the broth has evaporated into a glaze and the asparagus is al dente, 2 to 3 minutes (or until a little more cooked\u2014how I like it!\u2014about 5 minutes). Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Slice the steak, arrange it on a serving platter, dollop as much of the miso butter as you want on top, and serve the asparagus alongside."
