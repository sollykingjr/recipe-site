    "1tablespoon pine nuts",
    "8oz sirloin steak",
    "2heaping teaspoons green pesto",
    "1\u00bdoz arugula",
    "\u00bdoz Parmesan cheese"

  "directions": [
    "Put a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat, toasting the pine nuts as it heats up, tossing regularly and removing when golden. Cut the fat off the sirloin, finely chop the fat, and place in the pan to render and crisp up while you cut the sinew off the sirloin, then season it with sea salt and black pepper. Place between two sheets of parchment paper and bash to \u00bd inch thick with a rolling pin, also tenderizing the meat. Scoop out and reserve the crispy bits of fat, then sear the steak in the hot pan for 1 minute on each side, until golden but still blushing in the middle. Remove to a board.",
    "Spread the pesto over a serving platter. Thinly slice the steak at an angle, then plate up. Pile the arugula on top, then scatter over the pine nuts and reserved crispy fat, if you like. Mix the steak resting juices with 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and drizzle over. Shave over the Parmesan, tossing before serving."
