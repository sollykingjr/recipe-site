  ],
  "directions": [
    "Whisk together the gochujang, honey, miso, water, vinegar, oil, and salt in a small bowl until smooth.",
    "Place the chicken in a zip-top bag and pour the marinade over. Seal the bag and massage the marinade into the legs to make sure they are coated. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 48 hours.",
    "When ready to cook, heat the oven to 400\u00b0F or set up a grill for indirect cooking (in a charcoal grill, heap the coals on one side of the kettle so there\u2019s a hot zone and a cooler zone).",
    "Remove the chicken from the marinade, scraping off excess to avoid burning. Pour the marinade into a bowl and set aside.",
    "For roasting: Place the legs skin-side up on a rack set inside a roasting pan. Roast for 45 minutes, basting twice with some of the reserved marinade during the last 15 minutes of cooking.",
    "For grilling: Oil the grate with a paper towel soaked in oil and set the legs skin-side down over the warmest part of the fire for 2 to 3 minutes, then flip and sear the reverse side. Move to a slightly cooler spot on the grill, cooking indirectly over the coals to avoid flare-ups, for about 30 minutes. Brush with some reserved marinade and cook, flipping often over the hot coals, until a crust forms and the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes longer. Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving.",
    "Sprinkle with scallions. Serve the chicken with rice, kimchi, scallion salad, and lettuce leaves."
