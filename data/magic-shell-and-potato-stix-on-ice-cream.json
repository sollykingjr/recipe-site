    "1cup semisweet chocolate chips",
    "3tablespoons coconut oil",
    "For Serving",
    "1pint vanilla or chocolate ice cream",
    "4handfuls of potato sticks (like the Utz brand)",
    "Kosher salt"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "To make the magic shell: Combine the chocolate chips and coconut oil in a double boiler (small pot, inch of simmering water, heatproof bowl perched on top) and let melt, stirring until smooth. Or nuke them in microwave-safe bowl on high in 30-second intervals, stirring between each go. Give it one more good stir and let it cool to room temp.",
    "It keeps in an airtight container at room temperature for approximately one decade. The surface might look a little dusty, which is normal. Briefly microwave if it solidifies between uses.",
    "To serve: Scoop the ice cream into bowls (or just leave in the carton), spoon on the magic shell however you want, and garnish with a handful of potato sticks and a pinch of salt. Eat."
