  "ingredients": [
    "2x 4-oz boneless, skinless chicken breasts",
    "2limes",
    "4cloves of garlic",
    "2heaping tablespoons peanut butter",
    "1\u20132fresh red chilies"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Turn the broiler on to medium-high. Score the chicken breasts in a criss-cross fashion, rub with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, and the finely grated zest of 1 lime. Place criss-cross side down in a cold 10-inch non-stick ovenproof frying pan and put it on a medium-high heat while you peel and finely grate the garlic into a bowl. Squeeze in the juice from 1\u00bd limes, stir in the peanut butter, and loosen with enough water to give you a spoonable consistency. Finely slice the chili, then mix (as much as you dare!) through the sauce, taste, and season to perfection.",
    "Flip the chicken over, spoon over the sauce, then transfer to the broiler, roughly 4 inches from the heat, for 5 minutes, or until gnarly and cooked through. Finely grate over the remaining lime zest, then drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Serve with lime wedges, for squeezing over."
