    "1. Make the dressing:- In a large bowl, whisk together \u00bd cup sour cream, \u00bc cup mayonnaise, \u00bd cup grated cotija cheese, and \u00be teaspoon salt.- Add \u00bc cup adobo sauce from 1 (7.5-ounce) can of chipotles in adobo.- Finely grate 1 large garlic clove and the zest of \u00bd of the lime into the dressing. Squeeze the juice of both limes into the dressing. Whisk well to combine.",
    "2. Prep and scrunch the cabbage:- Remove and discard any floppy, wilty, or bruised outer leaves from 1 large napa cabbage. Cut the cabbage in quarters through the root. Thinly slice each quarter crosswise into roughly \u00bd-inch-thick strips.- Add the cabbage to the bowl of dressing, season it with \u00be teaspoon salt, and squeeze and scrunch with your hands to help massage the dressing into the cabbage and break down some of that toughness.",
    "3. Prep the add-ins:- Remove and discard the skin of a rotisserie chicken. Pull the chicken meat off the bones, shredding it into bite-size pieces and adding it to the bowl of cabbage as you do.- Thinly slice 6 radishes crosswise into coins and coarsely chop 1 cup packed cilantro leaves and tender stems; add to the salad.- Coarsely chop or crush \u00bd cup toasted corn with the bottom of a small saucepan or other heavy, flat object; set aside for garnish.",
    "4. Toss and assemble:- Using tongs, toss the salad to evenly distribute and coat all the ingredients. You can be kind of aggressive with the tossing, since none of these ingredients are particularly delicate. Season the salad with more salt and black pepper as needed.",
    "5. Serve:- Divide the salad among bowls, piling it high \u2019cause it\u2019s more fun to eat that way. Scatter the chopped toasted corn over top, along with more grated cotija cheese."
