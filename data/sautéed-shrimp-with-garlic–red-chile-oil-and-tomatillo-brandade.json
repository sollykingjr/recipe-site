  "directions": [
    "1. Put the salt cod in a large bowl and cover it with cold water. Place in the refrigerator for 48 hours, changing the water twice during this time.",
    "2. Drain the cod and break it into pieces. Put it in a medium saucepan, add the milk, and simmer over medium heat until very soft, 30 to 45 minutes.",
    "3. While the cod is cooking, put the potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the potatoes are really tender, 25 to 30 minutes; drain well.",
    "4. Drain the cod, discarding the milk. Flake the cod with a fork and transfer to the bowl of a food processor. Add the potatoes and garlic and pulse 4 or 5 times. With the motor running, slowly add the oil and heavy cream until the mixture is smooth; season with salt and pepper. This can be made 4 hours ahead and refrigerated. Reheat in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water.",
    "5. Toss the shrimp with the ancho powder in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper.",
    "6. Heat half of the garlic\u2013red chile oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan over high heat. Add half of the shrimp to the pan and cook until golden brown and just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to a plate. Discard the oil in the pan, wipe out the pan with a paper towel, and repeat with the remaining oil and shrimp.",
    "7. Spoon some of the brandade in the center of each of 4 plates. Arrange the shrimp around the brandade, spoon the tomatillo-jalape\u00f1o salsa around the shrimp, and garnish with chopped cilantro."
