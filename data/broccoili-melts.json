  "directions": [
    "prep the broccoli rubble If you\u2019re using broccolini, cut it into 2-inch segments. If you\u2019re using regular broccoli, peel the stems with a vegetable peeler first, so that they cook evenly, and cut the rest into large chunks.",
    "Pour about a 1-inch puddle of salted water into a large saut\u00e9 pan and bring to a boil. Add the broccoli, cover with a lid, and steam for 2 minutes. Drain the broccoli well, and pat it dry on paper towels, wringing out as much extra liquid as possible. Chop it into small (roughly \u00bd-inch) bits.",
    "Wipe the saut\u00e9 pan dry, and place over medium heat. Add the olive oil, and heat it for a full minute. Add the garlic and the pepper flakes, and cook for 1 minute, or until the garlic is just beginning to turn golden. Add the broccoli, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more; season with salt. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, and add the lemon zest and juice, Pecorino, and more salt and pepper flakes to taste.",
    "make the toasts Heat the broiler. Arrange the slices of bread on a tray, and lightly toast on both sides, about 1 minute each. Scoop the broccoli mixture onto each slice of bread, lay a slice of provolone over it, and run it under the broiler until the cheese has melted and begun to blister, anywhere from 1 to 4 minutes, depending on the robustness of your oven. Eat. Repeat. Don\u2019t forget to share, or at least hide the evidence if you decide not to do so.",
