  "ingredients": [
    "3tablespoons olive oil",
    "2egg whites",
    "2tablespoons rice flour (see Note)",
    "2teaspoons Lawry\u2019s Seasoned Salt, plus more for sprinkling",
    "1\u00bdpounds smallish sweet potatoes, skin on, cut lengthwise into 1-inch-thick wedges"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F. Place the oil on a large rimmed baking sheet and heat it in the oven until very hot but not smoking, 7 to 8 minutes.",
    "Hand-whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes. (Or use an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and reduce the time to about 2 minutes.) Gently fold in the rice flour and Lawry\u2019s, then gently toss the potatoes in the egg white mixture.",
    "Using an oven mitt, remove the baking sheet from the oven and quickly arrange the coated potato wedges on the hot oil, making sure a flat side of each potato is coming into direct contact with the oil. Roast until the undersides are crispy, 13 to 15 minutes. Flip the wedges with tongs and roast until the other side is golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with additional Lawry\u2019s, if desired."
