  "ingredients": [
    "1small white onion or 4 scallions",
    "10\u00bdounces zucchini",
    "\u00bccup extra-virgin olive oil",
    "salt",
    "about 1 pound linguine",
    "2whole eggs, plus 2 extra yolks",
    "1cup grated Parmesan",
    "freshly ground black pepper",
    "a few basil leaves"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Thinly slice the onion and cut the zucchini into 2-inch-long, 1/16-inch-thick strips. In a large frying pan, warm the olive oil over medium heat, then cook the onion and zucchini gently with a pinch of salt, turning them regularly with a wooden spoon, until they are very soft and tender\u2014about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.",
    "Add salt to the boiling water, stir, then add the linguine, fanning it out and using a wooden spoon to gently press and submerge the strands. Cover the pot until the water comes back to a boil, then remove the lid and continue cooking until the linguine is al dente (check the cooking time on the package and start tasting at least 2 minutes earlier).",
    "While the pasta is cooking, in a largish bowl, whisk together the eggs, extra yolks, cheese, a pinch of salt, and plenty of black pepper. During the last minute of pasta-cooking time, put the frying pan back on the heat to warm both the fat and vegetables. Drain the pasta, reserving a cup of the cooking water. Add the pasta to the frying pan, stirring so it tangles with the zucchini strips. Remove from the heat and add the egg-and-cheese mixture and a little cooking water. Using a wooden spoon, mix everything together vigorously so that each strand is coated with a creamy sauce, adding a little more cooking water if the sauce is too stiff. Tear the basil and add it to the pan. Serve immediately."
