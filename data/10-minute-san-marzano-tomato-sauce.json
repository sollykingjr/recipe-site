  "ingredients": [
    "2 (28-ounce) cans whole San Marzano tomatoes (make sure they are labeled DOP)",
    "\u00bd cup extra-virgin olive oil",
    "8 garlic cloves, smashed with the flat side of a chef\u2019s knife",
    "1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "\u00bc teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes",
    "1 tablespoon sugar",
    "2 sprigs basil",
    "To serve with pasta",
    "\u00bd cup kosher salt",
    "1\u00bd pounds dried pasta, such as spaghetti, angel hair, or rigatoni"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "In a food processor, pulse the tomatoes (including the liquid) until they\u2019re broken up but still chunky (you\u2019ll have about 7 cups). You can also do this with your hands, though it will produce a chunkier sauce.",
    "In a medium pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is golden and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the pepper flakes and stir. Stir in the tomatoes and cook until the sauce comes to a boil, 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat and season with the sugar, then stir in the basil sprigs.",
    "Let the basil steep in the sauce for at least 5 minutes and up to 30 minutes, then remove the basil and garlic from the sauce before serving. The sauce is ready to be used at this point, or it can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.",
    "To serve with pasta: In a large pot, bring 4 quarts water and the salt to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook according to the package directions. Drain and add the pasta to the sauce, tossing to coat. Serve immediately."
