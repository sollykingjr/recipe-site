    "3. To scramble the eggs, heat the butter over low heat in a large skillet. Add the eggs, season with salt and pepper to taste, and cook slowly, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until soft curds form, 3 to 5 minutes.",
    "4. To serve the chilaquiles, place a teaspoon of the sour cream in 4 large shallow bowls to secure the tortillas. Place a fried tortilla on top of each dab of sour cream. Spread a tablespoon of the sour cream evenly over each tortilla and top with some of the eggs and then Cheddar cheese. Repeat to make layers, then top the stacks with the remaining 4 tortillas. Ladle the warm roasted tomatillo sauce over the chilaquiles and garnish with chopped cilantro."
