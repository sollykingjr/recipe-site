  "directions": [
    "1. Make the broth: Heat the oil in a large saucepot over high heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Add the curry paste, curry powder, and 1 cup of the coconut milk and cook the paste for about 5 minutes, until it begins to look curdled. Deglaze with the fish sauce and cook for 1 minute. Add the palm sugar and cook a few minutes longer, until melted.",
    "2. Add the remaining coconut milk, chicken stock, and chili flakes and bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened to a sauce consistency.",
    "3. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until it registers 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Remove a quarter of the noodles and fry them, in batches if necessary, in the oil for about 2 minutes, until golden brown and crispy. Drain on the baking sheet.",
    "4. Bring the khao soi base to a simmer, add the chicken thighs, and cook for about 5 minutes, until the chicken is just cooked through. Season to taste with lime juice and fish sauce.",
    "5. Put the cooked noodles in a bowl, ladle the broth on top, and add some of the cooked chicken. Garnish with the red onion, mustard greens, crispy noodles, and cilantro. Serve with a lime wedge. Traditionally, the mustard greens and red onion are served on the side."
