    "Here\u2019s what to do:",
    "Toss the onion, peppers, garlic, cilantro, ground pepper, lime zest and juice, fish sauce, and coconut aminos into a blender, and\u2026",
    "\u2026blitz everything together until a bright green pur\u00e9e is formed.",
    "Place the chicken wings in a large bowl, and add the marinade.",
    "Mix well with your hands.",
    "Marinate the chicken in the fridge for at least 30 minutes and up to 12 hours. Don\u2019t marinate the wings longer than 12 hours because the acid will make the meat mushy. Ew.",
    "Take the wings out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before you intend to cook them.",
    "You can cook these chicken wings either in the oven or \u2013 if you can stand the chilly weather outside \u2013 on your backyard grill.",
    "Want to stay indoors? Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat it to 400\u00b0F on convection roast (or 425\u00b0F on the regular setting). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, and place a wire rack on top. Then, arrange the wings on the greased wire rack, and\u2026",
    "\u2026roast \u2018em for 30 minutes (flipping midway) or until the wings turn golden brown.",
    "If you\u2019re grilling the chicken wings, first use long-handled tongs to grease the cooking grate with a wad of paper towels dipped in melted fat. Then, cook the wings over medium-hot coals (or with gas grill burners set to medium) for about 15 minutes, turning once, until the fat has rendered and the skin turns crisp and golden.",
    "Serve with lime wedges, and let the feeding frenzy commence."
