  "directions": [
    "To brine that chicken: Heat 4 cups water with the salt and sugar in a medium pot, stirring occasionally, just until they dissolve, then let cool completely. Add the chicken so it\u2019s submerged (or put the chicken and brine in a big resealable bag) and put it in the fridge for at least 2 hours or up to 12 hours.",
    "To fry that chicken: An hour or so before you\u2019re ready to fry, drain the chicken, pat it dry, and let it come to room temp. Then get 2 inches of oil to 350\u00b0F in a medium heavy pot.",
    "While your oil heats up, whisk together the cornstarch, flour, black pepper, salt, cayenne, garlic powder, and 1 cup water in a medium bowl.",
    "When the oil\u2019s hot, one by one, dunk each thigh in the batter, so it\u2019s fully coated, then carefully add to the oil. To keep them from sticking to the pot or one another, I add two thighs to the oil, wait 2 or 3 minutes, then add the other two. Fry them, adjusting the heat to maintain 325-ish\u00b0F, until the crust is super-crackly and light brown and the center is cooked through (just cut into it and peek inside), about 15 minutes.",
    "When the thighs are done, pull them from the oil with tongs, shaking off any excess oil, and move them to a mixing bowl. Immediately and evenly sprinkle with the chicken spices, tossing to get as much of it to stick as possible. Let them hang out in the bowl.",
    "To assemble those sandwiches: Get a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet or griddle good and hot over medium heat.",
    "Swipe \u00bd teaspoon butter onto the cut side of each roll half, then cook the cut sides in batches until they\u2019re dark golden brown. It goes quick, like 30 seconds to 1 minute. When they\u2019re done, move them to the counter to build your sandwich.",
    "Evenly swipe about 1 teaspoon mayo on each roll half. On each roll bottom, pile on 2 lettuce leaves, 3 or 4 pickle chips, and the chicken. Squeeze a generous spritz of lemon juice onto the chicken on each sandwich and top with the other half of the roll. Eat. I love this sandwich."
