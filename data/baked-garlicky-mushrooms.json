Place it all (peel included) in a 12- x 10-inch roasting pan and drizzle with 1 tablespoon each of olive oil and red wine vinegar. Add a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and toss together. Pick out 12 perfect garlic slices and sage leaves for later, and sit the mushrooms stalk-side up on the top. Bake for 10 minutes.",
