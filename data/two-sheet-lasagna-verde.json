    "For the Spinach Dough:",
    "In a Vitamix blender, pur\u00e9e spinach and eggs until smooth. Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add flours and salt. Mix on speed 1 until dough is smooth and elastic, approximately 18 to 20 minutes. Wrap in plastic and let rest at room temperature.",
    "For the B\u00e9chamel Sauce:",
    "In a large pot over medium heat, melt butter. Add flour and whisk until a blond roux is formed. Add milk, onion, and nutmeg. Lower heat and simmer 20 minutes, whisking often. Strain through a chinois. Season with salt. Let cool.",
    "For the Beef Bolognese:",
    "Heat oven to 400\u00b0F. In a large rondeau, add ground beef and sear. Strain off rendered fat and reserve. Season browned meat with nutmeg, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and 175 grams salt. Set aside. In a separate large rondeau, heat oil. Add onions, carrots, and celery. Sweat until vegetables are mostly cooked through, approximately 8 to 10 minutes. Add chopped garlic and cook 2 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook additional 6 minutes, stirring constantly. Deglaze pan with wine and cook until liquid is reduced by one third. Remove mirepoix from heat and set aside. In two 6-inch hotel pans, evenly distribute tomatoes, cream, cooked mirepoix, cooked ground beef, and remaining 25 grams salt. Mix to combine. Cover with aluminum foil and braise 90 minutes. Remove from oven and add grated garlic, brandy, and vinegar. Cool pans over an ice bath while stirring frequently. Set aside.",
    "To Assemble and Serve:",
    "Heat wood-fired oven to 750\u00b0F. Set up a pasta machine to roll flat pasta. Starting at the widest setting, run the dough through successively narrower settings until it\u2019s a scant 1/8 inch thick. Transfer the sheet to a lightly floured work surface and dust with 00 flour. Cut dough into two 5.5-inch by 10-inch rectangles. In a large pot over medium high heat, bring salted water to a boil. Blanch lasagna sheets 1 minute. Shock in ice water then gently dry. On a sizzle tray, lay 1 sheet of dough. Layer with \u00bd cup B\u00e9chamel Sauce, \u00bd cup Beef Bolognese, and 2 tablespoons grated parmesan. Top with second sheet of dough and additional parmesan. Place in wood-fired oven and bake 2 minutes, or until cheese has melted and edges are beginning to char. Slide lasagna onto a serving plate. Garnish with nutmeg and parmesan."
