    "1small onion, chopped",

    "6garlic cloves, coarsely chopped",
    "4tablespoons kosher salt",
    "1tablespoon ground black pepper",
    "1tablespoon ground white pepper",
    "\u00bdteaspoon curing salt",
    "1teaspoon cayenne pepper",
    "1teaspoon chili powder",

  "directions": [
    "Combine the pork, liver, vegetables, and seasonings in a bowl and marinate for 1 hour or overnight, covered, in the refrigerator. Place the marinated mixture in a large pot and cover the meat with water (by 1 to 2 inches). Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the meat is tender, about 1 hour and 45 minutes.Remove the pot from the heat and strain, reserving the liquid. Allow the mixture to cool slightly, then put the solids through a meat grinder set on coarse grind. (You can also chop with a knife if you don\u2019t have a meat grinder, which is what I usually do anyway.)Place the ground meat in a large bowl. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, mix in the cooked rice, parsley, scallions, and the reserved cooking liquid. Stir vigorously for 5 minutes. When the boudin-rice mixture is first combined, it looks very wet and it\u2019s pretty spicy. Don\u2019t worry; after poaching, the rice absorbs the excess moisture and much of the spice. The wet texture and extra spice ensure that your final boudin will be moist and full of flavor.At this point you can feed the sausage into the casings (see Sidebar). Poach the links gently in hot (not bubbling) water for about 10 minutes, then serve. Alternatively, you can use the mixture as a stuffing for chicken, or roll it into \u201cboudin balls,\u201d dredge in bread crumbs, and fry in hot oil until golden brown."
