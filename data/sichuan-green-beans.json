  "directions": [
    "1. Adjust oven rack 8 inches from the broiler element and heat the broiler. Combine beans with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a bowl and toss to coat. Spread on a rimmed baking sheet (do not wash the bowl). Broil beans until softened and charred in places, 10 to 15 minutes, flipping beans halfway through broiling. Return beans to the bowl, add salt, and toss to distribute evenly. Cover with a plate. Stir Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, and sugar together in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved, and set aside.",
    "2. Combine the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil, chiles, and peppercorns in a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok and cook over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add pork, and mash and smear into the wok until the pork and garlic mixture are evenly combined. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook, chopping meat into 1/4-inch chunks with the edge of the spatula, until pork is cooked through, about 2 minutes.",
    "3. Add beans and yacai and toss to combine. Add Shaoxing wine mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until no liquid remains in the wok, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle with sesame oil and serve."
