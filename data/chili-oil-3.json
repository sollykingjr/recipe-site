    "1. In a wok or frying pan over high heat, warm the oil with the star anise, cassia bark, cardamom, scallions, and ginger, until the spices are bubbling and it reaches 285\u00b0F / 140\u00b0C on an instant-read thermometer.2. In a heatproof bowl or container, combine the chili powder and sesame seeds.3. Once the oil is at temperature, remove the solids with a slotted spoon or fine-mesh sieve. Slowly pour the oil over the chili powder and stir. You should see and hear a delightful sizzle and immediately smell the release of fragrance from the chili powder.4. Once the chili oil has cooled, transfer to an airtight jar and store in a cool, dark place for up to 3 months. You can use the chili oil right away, but it will taste best after sitting for several days."
