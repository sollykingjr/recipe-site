    "2large eggs (3.5 oz / 100g), cold from the refrigerator",

  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven and prepare the baking sheet: Arrange an oven rack in the center position and preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.",
    "Brown the butter: Measure out 4 ounces (113g) of the butter and set aside in a large bowl. In a small saucepan, cook the remaining 4 ounces (113g) butter over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the butter comes to a boil. Continue to cook, scraping the bottom and sides of the pan constantly with a heatproof spatula, until the butter sputters, foams, and eventually you see browned bits floating about, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the browned butter to the bowl with the other butter, making sure you scrape in all the browned bits, then add the heavy cream (no need to stir). Set aside to cool.",
    "Mix the dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda to combine. Set it aside.",
    "Mix the batter: To the bowl with the browned butter mixture (it can be slightly warm, just make sure it\u2019s not hot), add the brown and granulated sugars and whisk vigorously until the mixture is very smooth and thick, about 45 seconds (since we\u2019re not going for a light and cakey cookie texture, you don\u2019t need a mixture that\u2019s light and fluffy). Add the eggs and vanilla and whisk until the mixture is satiny, about 45 seconds. Add the flour mixture and whisk until the batter is smooth and well combined. It will look a little loose\u2014this is normal. Switch to a flexible spatula to scrape down the bowl, folding to make sure everything is well incorporated. Add both the chocolates (whole disks and chopped) and mix to combine. Set the batter aside for 5 minutes to firm up slightly.",
    "Scoop and chill the dough: Using a 2-ounce scoop or \u00bc-cup measure, scoop level portions of dough and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet as close together as possible (you\u2019ll space them out before baking). Cover the sheet tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours and up to 48 (if you\u2019re pressed for time, a couple of hours in the refrigerator will do\u2014just note the baked cookies won\u2019t be as chewy or wrinkly-looking).",
    "Preheat the oven and prepare the pans: When you\u2019re ready to bake, arrange two oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.",
    "Bake the first batch of cookies: Place 6 pieces of chilled cookie dough on each of the prepared baking sheets, spacing them so they\u2019re at least 3 inches apart. Bake the cookies on the upper and lower racks until they are dark golden brown around the edges, 18 to 22 minutes, switching racks and rotating the sheets front to back after 12 minutes. Allow the cookies to rest for 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then use a metal spatula to transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool.",
    "Bake the remaining cookies: Carefully move one of the oven racks to the center position, place the remaining dough on one of the baking sheets (it\u2019s okay if it\u2019s still warm), and bake on the center rack (this last sheet might bake a bit faster than the first two)."
