  "directions": [

    "Mix the dough: In a stand mixer with dough hook (or by hand), combine flours and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Mix until a shaggy dough forms. Knead until smooth and stiff, 8\u201310 minutes. Add more flour as needed.",

    "Form bagels: Punch down dough, divide into 9 pieces (about 4 oz each), shape into rings, place on baking sheets, and cover. Refrigerate overnight.",
    "Float test: Test if bagels float in room-temp water. If not, let rise at room temp until they do. Then refrigerate until ready to cook.",
