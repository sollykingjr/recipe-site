    "\u00bdcup (50 grams) old-fashioned rolled oats",
    "2tablespoons (30 ml) maple syrup",
    "A couple pinches of sea salt"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.",
    "In a small dish, stir the oats, syrup, and salt together until the oats are coated with liquid. Spread the sticky mixture out on a small parchment-lined baking sheet in a thin layer; the oats should be touching each other but not in any piles. Bake for 10 minutes and take a look. You want it to be toasted light golden at the edges\u2014this usually takes 3 more minutes, but it\u2019s always safer to check. Remove from the oven, and let the brittle cool completely on the baking sheet, then lift it off in one pleasing sheet and break into chunks."
