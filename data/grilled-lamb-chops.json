    "2small, \u00be-inch-thick lamb chops or cutlets per person",
    "salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "a sprig of rosemary, chopped",
    "extra-virgin olive oil, to marinate",
    "boiled new potatoes and salsa verde (here), to serve"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Put the lamb chops in a shallow dish, season with salt and pepper, add the rosemary and a good amount of olive oil, and leave the chops to marinate, turning them from time to time, for 1 hour.",
    "Heat a grill pan or frying pan until it is very hot, then grill the chops, without pressing them down, for 3 minutes on one side, then 3 on the other, by which point they should be burnished on the outside but tender and pink inside. Lift onto a warmed plate and serve immediately."
