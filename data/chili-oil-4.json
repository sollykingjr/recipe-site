  "ingredients": [
    "1\u00bdcups oil (ideally a vegetable, peanut, or grapeseed oil...light olive oil is fine, but it has a tendency to set in the fridge)",
    "5star anise",
    "1cinnamon stick, preferably cassia cinnamon",
    "2bay leaves",
    "3tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns",
    "\u00becup Asian crushed red pepper flakes (Sichuan chili flakes are the best)",
    "1 - 1\u00bdteaspoons salt (to taste)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Heat the oil, star anise, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, and Sichuan peppercorns in a small saucepan over medium high heat. When the oil starts to bubble slightly, turn the heat down to medium.",
    "Let the oil cook for 30 minutes like this. If you start to see that slight bubbling die down, periodically turn the heat back up to medium-high, then back down to medium if it gets too hot.",
    "When the oil is done cooking, the seeds and pods should be darker in color, but not blackened (that means they burned, which results in subpar chili oil). Let the oil cool for 5 minutes. In a separate heat-proof bowl, measure out the crushed red pepper flakes and salt.",
    "Remove the aromatics from the oil. Slowly pour the oil over the chili flakes, and stir well. When completely cooled, transfer to a jar, and store in the refrigerator. The oil will keep for up to 6 months when stored this way (always remember to use a clean spoon to dip into the jar!)"
