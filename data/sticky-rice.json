  "ingredients": [
    "2cups sticky rice (glutinous or sweet rice, preferably long-grain)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Put the rice in a large pot and cover by 4 inches with cold water. Soak the rice for at least 6 hours and up to 12 hours. Drain the rice through a mesh strainer.",
    "2. Pour the rice into a steamer basket. Boil a few inches of water over high heat in a wok or a pot large enough to fit the steamer basket. Make sure that the rice does not dip down into the water. Cover and steam for 25 minutes and eat.",
    "3. If you do not have a steamer basket: Drain the rice using a fine mesh sieve or colander (line with cheesecloth if the colander holes are too large). Place the rice over a pot of rapidly simmering water (don\u2019t allow water to touch the sieve) and steam, covered, for 15 minutes.",
    "4. Remove the lid and flip the rice over. Continue steaming, covered, for 10 minutes, until the rice is translucent and glossy. Taste to make sure the rice is completely cooked; it may take up to 10 minutes more. Remove from the heat, then cover and let rest for 5 minutes."
