  "directions": [
    "Fill a large saucepan with about 3 quarts (3 L) water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the quinoa, give it a stir, and cook, uncovered, until the grains are tender but not mushy, about 12 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking. Drain thoroughly, transfer to a large bowl, and let cool completely.",
    "Put the kale in a large bowl, add the lemon juice and salt, toss, and massage briefly with your fingertips\u2014this will slightly break down the fibers of the kale and make its texture less chewy. Let the kale sit for a few minutes before serving to blend the flavors and soften the kale a bit. Add the quinoa, oil, cilantro, cranberries, almonds (reserve a few for decoration), and several twists of pepper and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed. The salad is best fresh, but will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days."
