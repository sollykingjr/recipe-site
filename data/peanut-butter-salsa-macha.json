  "ingredients": [
    "1cup grapeseed oil or vegetable oil",
    "5garlic cloves, peeled",
    "8dried pasilla chiles, stemmed, slit open, and seeded",
    "12dried arbol chiles, stemmed, slit open, and seeded",
    "1cup chunky peanut butter (the natural stuff!)",
    "2teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal or about half as much Morton)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Combine the oil and garlic in a small, heavy pot (narrow enough so the oil submerges the garlic). Turn the heat to medium-high and cook until the garlic is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to move the garlic to a bowl. Leave the oil in the pot and keep the heat on.",
    "Add the pasilla chiles, two or three at a time (they cook really quick, so be ready) to the hot oil and fry, holding them under with a strainer and using the strainer to pull them out as soon as they blister, 5 to 10 seconds. As they\u2019re done, move them to the bowl with the garlic. Fry the arbol chiles in the same way until they darken slightly, 5 to 10 seconds, then move them to the bowl.",
    "Let the oil cool to warm, pour it into a food processor, and add the garlic and chiles. Buzz for about 20 seconds, then add the peanut butter and salt and buzz until pretty smooth, another 15 to 30 seconds. Now it\u2019s done.",
    "It keeps in the fridge for up to 2 weeks."
