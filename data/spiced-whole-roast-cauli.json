  "ingredients": [
    "1small head of cauliflower (1\u00bc lbs)",
    "2heaping teaspoons rose harissa",
    "2heaping tablespoons plain yogurt",
    "1pomegranate",
    "1tablespoon dukkah"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Discard any tough outer leaves from the cauliflower, then, keeping it whole, use a sharp knife to carefully slice a cross deep into the stalk so you can easily portion it up later. In a bowl, mix together the harissa, yogurt, \u00bd a tablespoon of red wine vinegar, and a little sea salt and black pepper, then quickly rub the mixture all over the cauli. Place it in a snug-fitting ovenproof frying pan or roasting pan. Halve the pomegranate and squeeze the juice of one half through a sieve over the cauli. Add \u00bd cup of water at the base, and roast for 1 hour 15 minutes.",
    "When the time\u2019s up, baste the cauli with the juices in the pan, then return to the oven for a final 10 minutes. Remove the pan, spoon the juices back over the cauli, then quickly sprinkle over the dukkah so it sticks. Holding the remaining pomegranate half cut-side down in your fingers, bash the back of it with a spoon so all the seeds tumble over the cauli, then halve or quarter, and dish up."
