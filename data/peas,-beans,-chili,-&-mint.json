Meanwhile, halve and seed the chili and finely chop with the top leafy half of the mint. Place in a bowl, finely grate over a little lemon zest, then squeeze in all the juice. Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, mix, taste, and season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper.",
    "Drain the beans and peas, reserving a cupful of cooking water and discarding the mint stalks. Pinch the skins off any larger beans, then pour the beans and peas onto a platter, toss with a few splashes of reserved cooking water, then spoon over the dressing. Drizzle with 1 more tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and toss together at the table before tucking in."
