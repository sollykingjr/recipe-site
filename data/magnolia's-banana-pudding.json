  "ingredients": [
    "One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk",
    "11/2cups ice cold water",
    "One 3.4-ounce package instant vanilla pudding mix (preferably Jell-O brand)",
    "3cups heavy cream",
    "One 12-ounce box Nabisco Nilla Wafers (no substitutions!)",
    "4cups sliced ripe bananas",
    ""
  ],
  "directions": [
    "In a small bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, beat together the sweetened condensed milk and water until well combined, about 1 minute. Add the pudding mix and beat well, about 2 minutes more. Cover and refrigerate for 3\u20134 hours or overnight, before continuing. It is very important to allow the proper amount of time for the pudding mixture to set.",
    "In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the pudding mixture into the whipped cream until well blended and no streaks of pudding remain.",
    "To assemble the dessert, select a large, wide bowl (preferably glass) with a 4\u20135-quart capacity. Arrange one-third of the wafers to cover the bottom of the bowl, overlapping if necessary, then one-third of the bananas and one-third of the pudding. Repeat the layering twice more, garnishing with additional wafers or wafer crumbs on the top layer of the pudding. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to chill in the refrigerator for 4 hours\u2014or up to 8 hours, but no longer!\u2014before serving."
