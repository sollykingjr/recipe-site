  "ingredients": [
    "Four 8-inch French or hoagie rolls, split",
    "\u00bdcup Ocean Spray Jellied Cranberry Sauce",
    "Heaping \u00bd cup Bellair-Style Herb Mayo (this page)",
    "1pound sliced (ideally \u215b inch thick) smoky ham",
    "4cups nice spicy arugula",
    "8ounces super-sharp cheddar, sliced \u215b inch thick"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Move an oven rack 8 inches or so from your broiler and preheat the broiler. Toast the rolls, cut-sides up, under the broiler for a minute or so, just until they\u2019re golden brown and crackly but still soft inside.",
    "Give the cranberry sauce a good stir so it\u2019s spreadable, then spread it on the top halves of each roll. Spread the herb mayo on the bottom halves.",
    "For each sandwich, put a fourth of the ham on the roll bottoms (feel free to artistically fold each slice like they do at Subway). Pile on about 1 cup of the arugula (it\u2019s a lot, so just try your best to tuck it in there). Then puzzle-piece on a fourth of the cheese in an even layer with minimal overhang. Throw the tops on those bad boys and eat."
