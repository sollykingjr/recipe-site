  "directions": [
    "1. Bring 2 cups Marsala, gelatin, and porcini mushrooms to boil in medium saucepan, then reduce heat to medium-high and simmer vigorously until reduced by half, 6 to 8 minutes.",
    "2. Meanwhile, cut each chicken breast in half crosswise, then cut thick half in half horizontally, creating 3 cutlets of similar thickness. Pound cutlets to uniform \u00bd-inch thickness. Place cutlets in bowl and toss with salt and pepper. Set aside for 15 minutes.",
    "3. Strain Marsala reduction through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Return Marsala reduction to saucepan, add broth, and return to boil. Reduce heat to medium-high and simmer until reduced to 1\u00bd cups, 10 to 12 minutes; set aside.",
    "4. Spread flour in shallow dish. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge cutlets in flour, shaking gently to remove excess. Place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place 6 cutlets in skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook until golden brown on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Return cutlets to wire rack. Repeat with 2 tablespoons oil and remaining 6 cutlets; return to wire rack.",
    "5. Cook pancetta in now-empty skillet over medium-low heat, scraping up any browned bits, until brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Stir in cremini mushrooms, increase heat to medium-high, and cook until mushrooms begin to brown, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer cremini mushrooms and pancetta to bowl. Add remaining 1 teaspoon oil and shallot to fat left in pan and cook until softened, 1 minute. Add tomato paste and garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in lemon juice, oregano, reduced Marsala mixture, and remaining \u00bc cup Marsala and bring to simmer.",
    "6. Nestle cutlets into sauce and simmer for 3 minutes, flipping halfway through simmering. Transfer cutlets to platter. Off heat, whisk butter into sauce in skillet. Stir in parsley and cremini mushroom mixture and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over chicken and serve."
