  "directions": [
    "ROAST THE SQUASH: Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and pour 2 tablespoons of the oil on the lined sheet. Place the oiled sheet in the oven (yep, nothing on it) and heat until very hot but not smoking, about 8 minutes.",
    "In a large bowl, toss the squash with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, the salt, pepper, and cayenne until coated. Using an oven mitt, remove the hot baking sheet from the oven and quickly pour the squash onto the sheet (you should hear some sizzling); take a few extra seconds to make sure the flat sides of the squash are hitting that hot oiled pan. Roast until the undersides are golden, about 15 minutes. Remove the squash from the oven, shake the pan (or flip the squash with tongs if you\u2019re down with OCD, yeah you know me), return to the oven, and roast until the new underside is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool to room temp or just warm (so it doesn\u2019t murder the greens when you drop them on).",
    "MAKE THE DRESSING: In a screw-top jar, shake the vinegar, mustard, honey, garlic, salt, pepper, and oil until it\u2019s creamy. (If it separates, just shake it again.)",
    "MAKE THE SALAD: Arrange the arugula on a platter. Top with the roasted squash, pomegranate seeds, and pumpkin seeds. Scatter the onion and goat cheese on top. Drizzle with the dressing to taste and sprinkle with pepper."
