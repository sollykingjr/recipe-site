  "ingredients": [
    "2 \u00bd",
    "cups corn kernels, preferably fresh cut from 2-3 cobs",
    "\u00bd",
    "cup full fat coconut milk",
    "\u00bc",
    "cup butter, melted and cooled slightly, plus more for greasing baking pan",
    "\u00be",
    "cup granulated sugar",
    "large eggs",
    "\u00bd",
    "tsp vanilla extract",
    "cups glutinous rice flour (I use Koda Farms Blue Star Mochiko)",
    "tsp baking powder",
    "\u00bd",
    "tsp salt"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Place corn kernels and coconut milk in a high-speed blender. Blend until very smooth. Place remaining ingredients and blend again until smooth.",
    "If you don\u2019t have a high-speed blender, use an immersion blender or food processor to blend the corn and coconut milk until smooth. Then, in a medium bowl, whisk the \u201ccorn milk\u201d with melted butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla until smooth. In a separate large bowl, whisk glutinous rice flour, baking powder and salt. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients. Whisk until very smooth and no streaks of white remain. There is no gluten in \u201cglutinous rice flour\u201d so you don\u2019t need to worry about over-mixing this batter.",
    "Pour batter into greased baking pan. Give the pan a few hard taps on the counter to knock out air bubbles. Bake for about 60 minutes, or until center is set but bounces back when pushed, and edges are golden brown.",
    "Set pan on a wire rack to cool fully to room temperature. If you can\u2019t wait until it cools to room temperature, the mochi cake will be more custardy and gooey but not yet its maximum chewiness. Store in an air-tight container at room temperature up to one day or in the fridge for longer periods."
