  "directions": [
    "Slice the chicken breast horizontally in half, giving you 2 fillets, each about \u00bd inch thick. Season with the salt.",
    "Set up a breading station by lining up three shallow trays\u2014pie tins work well\u2014and filling them with the flour, egg, and panko, respectively. Lightly beat the egg. One at a time, coat each piece of chicken with flour, gently dusting off any excess, then give it a dip in the egg and, finally, a coating of panko. Don\u2019t be stingy with the bread crumbs\u2014cover the whole piece of chicken and press down gently to ensure a good coating.",
    "Fill a medium skillet with \u00bc inch of oil and heat over medium heat to about 350\u00b0F. You can tell that the oil is ready if you toss a few panko crumbs into the oil and they immediately begin to sizzle. Carefully slide one piece of chicken into the oil and fry, turning once, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel or wire rack to drain while you fry the other piece.",
    "Trim the chicken pieces to fit the pieces of bread (eat the trimmings), then slather each slice of bread with mayo and Bull-Dog sauce and sandwich the chicken between them."
