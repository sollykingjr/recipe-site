  "ingredients": [
    "2\u00bcpounds clams, cleaned",
    "5tablespoons olive oil",
    "2garlic cloves",
    "\u00bdcup white wine",
    "10\u00bdounces spaghetti",
    "1small red chile or a pinch of red pepper flakes",
    "1tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Sit the clams in a sink full of salted cold water for at least 2 hours. Drain and rinse them well, discarding any that are open. Bring a large pan of well-salted water to a fast boil.",
    "In a large, deep frying pan or saut\u00e9 pan with a lid, warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-low heat, add a peeled and crushed garlic clove, and cook gently until fragrant. Add the clams and wine, cover the pan, and cook over lively heat, shaking the pan from time to time, until all the clams have opened (discard any that don\u2019t).",
    "Use a slotted spoon to lift the open clams from the pan into a bowl, then drain the clam broth through a very fine sieve and set aside. Rinse and dry the pan. Choose 25 or so of the nicest clams and set them aside in their shells, then pick out the flesh from the rest of the clams and set the meat aside too.",
    "Put the spaghetti in the by now boiling water and check the cooking time on the package; start tasting it 2 minutes earlier. Back in the frying pan, heat 2 more tablespoons of the olive oil and gently cook the second peeled and crushed garlic clove and the chile until fragrant. Add the clam broth and let it bubble and reduce for a few minutes before adding the reserved clams in their shells and cooking for a minute or so more.",
    "Once it is al dente, drain the pasta, reserving a little of the cooking water; add it to the clams and stir well. Add the parsley and remaining tablespoon olive oil, stirring so that each strand of spaghetti is coated with broth. Divide between 4 plates, making sure each one has its fair share of clams."
