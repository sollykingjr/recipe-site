  "ingredients": [
    "2cups (475 ml) water",
    "1cup (210 grams) uncooked semi-pearled farro",
    "\u00bdlarge onion (I usually use a white one, for mildness)",
    "2garlic cloves",
    "9ounces (255 grams) grape or cherry tomatoes",
    "1\u00bcteaspoons kosher or coarse sea salt",
    "Up to \u00bc teaspoon red pepper flakes, to taste",
    "1tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil, plus extra for drizzling",
    "A few fresh basil leaves, cut into thin ribbons",
    "Grated Parmesan, for serving (optional)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Place the water and farro in a medium saucepan to presoak (I find just 5 to 10 minutes sufficient) while you prepare the other ingredients. Adding each ingredient to the pot as you finish preparing it, cut the onion in half again, and very thinly slice it into quarter-moons. Thinly slice the garlic cloves as well. Halve or quarter the tomatoes. Add the salt, red pepper flakes to taste, and 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan, and set a timer for 30 minutes. Bring the uncovered pan to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer and continue to cook, stirring occasionally. When the timer rings, the farro should be perfectly cooked (tender but with a meaty chew) and seasoned, and the cooking water should be almost completely absorbed. If needed, though I\u2019ve never found it necessary, cook it for 5 additional minutes, until the farro is more tender.",
    "Transfer it to a wide serving bowl. If there\u2019s enough leftover cooking liquid to be bothersome, simply use a slotted spoon to leave behind whatever liquid you don\u2019t want. Drizzle the farro lightly with additional olive oil, and scatter with basil and Parmesan (if desired). Eat immediately. Repeat tomorrow."
