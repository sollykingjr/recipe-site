  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven to warm, or as low as it will go.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, pepper, and salt. In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, melted butter, and egg until incorporated. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until just incorporated (a few lumps are OK), then whisk in the Parm.",
    "Heat a standard waffle iron, brush with some melted butter, and make the waffles using between \u00bd to \u2154 cup batter per batch. Cook according to the waffle iron\u2019s directions or until the top and bottom are crisp and deep brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the waffle from the iron (you may have to pick at it from one of the ends with a fork, but, uh, don\u2019t electrocute yourself). Put the waffle on a baking sheet in the oven to keep warm while you cook the remaining waffles.",
    "Arrange a waffle on a plate and top with an egg and 2 slices of bacon, if using. Drizzle with syrup and sprinkle with a little more Parm and pepper."
