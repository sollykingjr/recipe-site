    "for 12 muffins:",
    "1stick unsalted butter, room temperature",
    "1 1/4cup granulated sugar",
    "2eggs, room temperature",
    "2tsp baking powder",
    "3/4tsp salt",
    "1.5tsp vanilla extract",
    "2cups all-purpose flour",
    "1/2cup milk",
    "2.5 - 3cups fresh blueberries*",
    "for the crumb topping:",
    "3/4cup all-purpose flour",
    "1/2cup granulated sugar",
    "1/2tsp ground cinnamon",
    "6tbsp cold, unsalted butter"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.",
    "To make the crumb topping: mix together all dry ingredients in a bowl, then throw in cubes of cold butter. Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the flour mixture. Continue to do so until you have chunks of various sizes, ranging from the size of a pea to the size of a penny. Set aside.",
    "In a small bowl, crush half of the blueberries using your fingers or a fork; the blueberries will burst and release their juices, guaranteeing moist muffins. Set aside.",
    "In a large bowl, cream the room temperature butter with the sugar using a hand or stand mixer.",
    "Add in the eggs and vanilla extract, mix to combine.",
    "Sprinkle in the baking powder and salt, and mix just until everything is incorporated.",
    "Alternate adding in the flour and milk; add half of the flour, combine, add half of the milk, combine, and repeat. DO NOT OVERMIX.",
    "Toss in the blueberries, whole + crushed, and fold them in gently just until they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re distributed evenly throughout the batter.",
    "Using an ice cream scoop (my favorite is linked in my Amazon storefront), scoop the batter and divide into a lined or well-greased muffin tray.",
    "Sprinkle the tops of each muffin with the streusel topping, or course sugar.",
    "Bake at 375F for 25-30 minutes, until the tops are golden and a toothpick comes out clean.",
    "Let the muffins cool for a few minutes prior to removing them from the pan.",
    "* You can swap fresh blueberries for frozen, but do keep in mind frozen berries tend to turn the muffin batter a dark purple/ grey shade. Fold them in gently to avoid that as much as possible. In order to be able to crush them, I would try thawing them first!"
