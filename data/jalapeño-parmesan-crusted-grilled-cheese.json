  "ingredients": [
    "3tablespoons butter, at room temperature",
    "4slices soft sourdough bread",
    "1small jalape\u00f1o, sliced into thin rings",
    "1cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese",
    "1cup shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Spread one side of each slice of bread with about 2 teaspoons softened butter. Arrange 4 or 5 jalape\u00f1o rings over the butter on each slice, pressing down to make them stick. Place the Parm in a shallow dish and press the buttered, jalape\u00f1o side of each slice of bread into the Parm. Scatter \u00bd cup cheddar on the unbuttered side of each of 2 slices, then close the sandwiches (all the Parmed sides on the outside).",
    "Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the sandwiches and cook, covered, until the underside is golden but not burnt, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook, covered, until the underside is golden but not burnt and the edges are crisp, 2 to 3 minutes."
