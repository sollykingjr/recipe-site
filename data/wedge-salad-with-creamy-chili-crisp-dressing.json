  "directions": [
    "1. Prepare the dressing: Mix the labne, buttermilk, dill, chives, mayonnaise, chili crisp, mustard, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Place in the refrigerator until ready to use.2. Make the topping (see Tip): Heat the canola oil and sliced garlic in a small saut\u00e9 pan over medium-low heat. Fry the garlic, stirring often, until lightly golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. The garlic won\u2019t seem very crisp at this point, but it will crisp up when fully cooled.3. Using a slotted spoon or skimmer, carefully transfer the garlic to a paper towel\u2013lined plate or small sheet pan to drain. Sprinkle with a touch of salt.4. Add the shallots to the same hot oil over medium-low heat, and cook, stirring frequently, until pale golden, 8 to 10 minutes. When the shallots are one shade lighter than golden brown, use the slotted spoon or skimmer to transfer them to a paper towel\u2013lined plate or small sheet pan to drain. They will crisp up more as they cool. Sprinkle with a touch of salt.5. Make the salad: Arrange the iceberg wedges on a platter. Spoon the dressing all over, and top with cilantro, dill, and mint. Finish with the crispy garlic and shallots, and serve."
