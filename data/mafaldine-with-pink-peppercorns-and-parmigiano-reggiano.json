  "ingredients": [
    "567g / 1 lb 4 oz extruded mafaldine",
    "114g / \u00bd cup unsalted butter, cold and cubed",
    "90g / 1 cup plus 22g / \u00bc cup finely grated parmigiano-reggiano",
    "8g / 3 Tbsp coarsely ground pink peppercorns"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1   Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Generously salt the water.",
    "2   Add the mafaldine to the water and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, until al dente.",
    "3   While the pasta is cooking, place a large saut\u00e9 pan over low heat. Add 4 ladles (230g / 1 cup) pasta cooking water to the pan. Gradually add half of the butter to the pan and stir to emulsify.",
    "4   Using tongs or a pasta basket, remove the pasta from the pot and transfer to the saut\u00e9 pan. Turn up the heat to medium. Toss for 1 to 2 minutes to marry the pasta and the sauce. Add the remaining butter and keep tossing the pasta until the butter is absorbed. If the sauce begins to tighten, add a splash of pasta water and continue tossing. The sauce should cling to the pasta but still glide easily in the pan.",
    "5   Remove from the heat and add 90g / 1 cup of the parmigiano and 5g / 2 Tbsp of the pink peppercorns. Continue tossing until evenly distributed.",
    "6   Divide the pasta into bowls. Garnish with the remaining 22g / \u00bc cup parmigiano and 3g / 1 Tbsp pink peppercorns."
