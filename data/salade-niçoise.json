    "1. For the dressing: Whisk lemon juice, shallot, basil, thyme, oregano, and mustard together in medium bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in oil until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside. (Dressing can be refrigerated up to 24 hours; whisk to recombine before using.)",
    "2. For the salad: Bring potatoes and 4 quarts cold water to boil in Dutch oven or stockpot over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon salt and cook until potatoes are tender when poked with paring knife, 5 to 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, gently transfer potatoes to medium bowl (do not discard boiling water). Toss warm potatoes with vermouth and season with salt and pepper to taste; let sit for 1 minute. Toss in \u00bc cup dressing; set aside.",
    "3. While potatoes cook, toss lettuce with \u00bc cup dressing in large bowl until coated. Arrange bed of lettuce on very large flat platter. Place tuna in now-empty bowl and break up with fork. Add \u00bd cup dressing and stir to combine; mound tuna in center of lettuce. Toss tomatoes and onion with 3 tablespoons dressing in now-empty bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Arrange tomato mixture in mound at edge of lettuce bed. Arrange potatoes in separate mound at opposite edge of lettuce bed.",
    "4. Return water to boil; add green beans and 1 tablespoon salt. Cook until crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, fill large bowl halfway with ice and water. Drain green beans; transfer to ice bath; and let sit until just cool, about 30 seconds. Dry green beans well on triple layer of paper towels. Toss green beans with 3 tablespoons dressing in now-empty bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Arrange in separate mound at edge of lettuce bed.",
    "5. Arrange eggs, olives, and anchovies (if using) in separate mounds at edge of lettuce bed. Drizzle eggs with remaining 2 tablespoons dressing; sprinkle salad with capers (if using). Serve immediately."
