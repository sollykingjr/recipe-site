  ],
  "directions": [
    "In a large soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until tender and translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 additional minute. Add the carrots and celery and cook until slightly softened, about 4 minutes.",
    "Add the broth, diced tomatoes, cannellini beans, green beans (with the liquid from the can), basil, oregano, 2\u00bd teaspoons salt, \u00bd teaspoon black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Increase the heat to high, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until the liquid thickens slightly, about 20 minutes.",
    "Add the pasta and cook until tender, another 10 minutes or so. Stir in the Parm and season to taste with salt and black pepper. Garnish with more Parm. Serve with the chili mayo toasts.",
    "If the soup cools completely, it\u2019ll thicken a lot because of the starch in the pasta. If it\u2019s too thick for you, add a little water or broth when you reheat it.",
    "Or use 1\u00bc cups fresh green beans cut into 2-inch lengths plus \u00be cup water."
