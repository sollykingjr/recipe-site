    "1  For the relish: Pulse bell pepper and jalape\u00f1o in food processor until coarsely chopped into \u00bc-inch pieces, about 8 pulses; transfer to bowl. Pulse onion and garlic in now-empty food processor until coarsely chopped into \u00bc-inch pieces, about 8 pulses; transfer to bowl with bell pepper mixture.",
    "2  Bring vinegar, sugar, mustard seeds, and salt to boil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add vegetable mixture, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until mixture has thickened, about 15 minutes. Let relish cool slightly, then transfer to bowl and let cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. (Relish can be refrigerated for up to 3 months; flavor will deepen over time.)",
    "3  For the burgers: Divide Brie into 4 equal portions; using your hands, mash each portion together into rough 2-inch disk. Break ground turkey into small pieces in large bowl. Add melted butter, Worcestershire, and pepper and gently knead with your hands until well combined.",
    "4  Divide turkey mixture into 8 equal portions. Encase each disk of cheese with 1 portion of turkey mixture to form mini burger patty. Mold second portion of turkey around each mini patty and seal edges to form ball. Flatten ball to form \u00be-inch-thick patty. Cover and refrigerate patties for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.",
    "5  Sprinkle patties with salt. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Transfer patties to skillet and cook until well browned on first side, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip patties, reduce heat to medium-low, and continue to cook until browned on second side and meat registers 160 degrees, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer burgers to platter and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve burgers on buns, topped with relish and lettuce."
