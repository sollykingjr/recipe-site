  "directions": [
    "1. To make each onigiri, place a 1-foot square of plastic wrap on a cutting board and drop the warm rice into the center.",
    "2. If you want to fill the onigiri, use your fingers or a spoon to flatten the rice into a layer about 1 inch thick. Place the filling in the center of the rice, then proceed, doing your best to keep the filling contained within the rice ball as you shape it. Gather the four corners of the plastic wrap together, lift up the rice, and twist the plastic together to force the rice together into a ball. Then use your hands to form the ball into a rough triangle, about 1 inch thick, twisting the plastic as necessary to compress the rice. This isn\u2019t an exact science. You\u2019re just using the plastic to help you form the rice. Remove the plastic and wrap the onigiri in a half-sheet of nori.",
    "optional Fillings",
    "Each of these suggestions makes enough for one onigiri; scale up as desired.",
