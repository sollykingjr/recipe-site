  "directions": [
    "1. Squeeze the juice of the lemons into a large bowl of cold water. Add the spent lemon rinds.2. Trim the artichokes down to the tender leaves, halve lengthwise, and scoop out the fuzzy choke. As you work, drop the cleaned artichokes into the bowl of water and lemon.3. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the artichokes, and simmer gently until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain well and let cool.4. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs, pecorino, parsley, mint, eggs, and onion to make a stiff, sticky mixture. Season well with salt and pepper.5. Stuff a small handful of the mixture into the cavity of each artichoke, gently packing it in to make it stick.6. Line a sheet pan with paper towels. Pour 1 inch (2.5 cm) of olive oil into a large heavy skillet and heat over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches if necessary, place as many artichokes as will fit, filling-side down, in the hot oil and cook until the filling is well browned, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes.7. Transfer to the paper towels to drain. Serve warm."
