    "2cups (480 g) kosher salt or other coarse salt",
    "3small, even-sized beets, unpeeled, trimmed, and scrubbed",
    "Fresh lemon juice",
    "1heaping tablespoon best-quality raw tahini (stir well before using), plus more if you like",
    "\u00bdteaspoon silan",
    "Maldon or other flaky salt, for serving"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Line a baking dish that fits the beets in one even layer (without too much crowding) with parchment paper.",
    "Spread the kosher salt in an even layer over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange the beets on the salt and roast until very tender when prodded with a knife or skewer, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes until you can handle them. Peel the beets (you may need to use a paring knife) and slice them into very thin rounds, ideally \u215b inch (3 mm) or thinner.",
    "Arrange the beets in one layer on a large shallow serving plate. Squeeze a generous teaspoon of lemon juice over the top. With a spoon, lightly drizzle on the tahini and silan, adding a bit more if needed to be sure every slice gets some of the flavorings, and sprinkle with Maldon salt. Serve warm or at room temperature."
