  "ingredients": [
    "1(15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed",
    "Extra-virgin olive oil",
    "1tablespoon za\u2019atar",
    "Diamond Crystal kosher salt"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Position a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat it to 400\u00b0F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.",
    "2. Dry the chickpeas well before adding them to a food processor. Pulse until they resemble coarsely ground bread crumbs, loosening them with a fork as necessary so you don\u2019t form a paste. Spread these out evenly on the lined sheet pan and drizzle all over with 3 tablespoons olive oil (you want them pretty covered). Season with the za\u2019atar and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Gently mix until everything is evenly coated.",
    "3. Roast the chickpeas until they are golden and dry, 20 to 25 minutes, shaking and stirring with a spatula halfway through to help them crisp up."
