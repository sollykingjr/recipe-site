  "ingredients": [
    "1head of garlic, cloves separated, peeled, and smashed with the back of a knife",
    "\u00bdcup olive oil",
    "1(2-ounce) tin anchovies (or half of a 4-ounce jar), drained",
    "\u00bdcup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened",
    "Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes (optional)",
    "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 or 2baguettes, halved lengthwise",
    "Flaky sea salt",
    "Finely chopped fresh parsley (optional)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.",
    "2 Heat the garlic and oil in a small pot over medium heat. Cook until the garlic has started to audibly sizzle, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting and continue to cook until the garlic is totally tender and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the anchovies and remove from heat.",
    "3 Transfer the oil mixture to a medium bowl along with the butter and red pepper flakes. Using a fork, smash everything together so that the garlic cloves break down and everything turns into a delicious, creamy paste. Season with salt and pepper. Using a spoon, evenly distribute this deliciousness onto each half of the bread, letting it really soak in there.",
    "4 Place the bread on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the edges are golden brown, with soft and supple centers (the only time I\u2019ll use the word supple), 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with flaky salt and parsley, if using."
