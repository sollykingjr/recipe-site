    "8starchy potatoes (about 2 pounds), such as russets or Yukon gold, peeled and cut into even chunks",
    "20scallions, some green tops included, chopped",
    "1 1/2cups milk",
    "1/4teaspoon white peppercorns",

    "1/2cup (1 stick) lightly salted butter, melted and hot"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Add the potatoes to a large saucepan of salted boiling water, cover, bring back to a boil, and simmer gently for 20 minutes, until tender. Drain well and put back in the pan. Cover with a clean dish towel for a few minutes to get rid of excess moisture.",
    "2. While the potatoes are cooking, put the chopped scallions in a saucepan with the milk and peppercorns. Simmer for 5 minutes, then drain, reserving the milk and scallions separately.",
    "3. Mash the potatoes until smooth, stirring in enough of the reserved milk to produce a creamy consistency. Stir in the scallions and chives. Season to taste with sea salt flakes and more pepper if necessary.",
    "4. Transfer the potato mixture to a warm serving dish. Make a well in the center and pour in the hot, melted butter. Serve immediately, mixing in the melted butter at the table."
