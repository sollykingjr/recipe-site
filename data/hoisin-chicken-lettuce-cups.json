  "ingredients": [
    "1ripe mango",
    "2tablespoons hoisin sauce",
    "2x 4-oz boneless, skinless chicken breasts",
    "1romaine lettuce (10 oz)",
    "1cup sprouting cress"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Put a grill pan on a high heat. Cut the two cheeks off the mango, slice each into three lengthways, then slice off the skin and discard. Dice all the flesh into \u00c2\u00bd-inch cubes. Scrunch the stone over a bowl, to extract any pulp and juice, mix with the hoisin to make a dressing, and divide between two little bowls.",
    "Flatten the chicken breasts by pounding them with your fists until the fat end is the same thickness as the skinny end. Rub with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then grill for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until bar-marked and cooked through. Meanwhile, trim the lettuce, click the leaves apart, and divide between two plates, snipping the cress alongside.",
    "Divide up the mango and the hoisin bowls. Slice the chicken and arrange on the plates, then tuck in, using the lettuce cups as a receptacle to hold everything."
