    "1pound spaghetti",
    "\u00becup ricotta",
    "\u00bdcup grated Parmesan",
    "freshly ground black pepper"

  "directions": [
    "Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add salt, stir, then add the spaghetti, fanning it out and using a wooden spoon to gently press and submerge the strands. Cover the pot until the water comes back to a boil, then remove the lid and continue cooking until it is al dente (check the cooking time on the package and start tasting at least 2 minutes earlier).",
    "Meanwhile, in a large warmed bowl (I wash mine under hot water, then dry it), mash the ricotta with the grated Parmesan and grind lots of black pepper over the top. Scoop out a ladleful of cooking water from the pasta pot, add it to the ricotta mixture, and stir until you have a soft, creamy sauce.",
    "Drain the pasta, reserving a little more cooking water, tip it into the bowl, and, using a spoon and a fork, toss the pasta in the sauce rapidly, lifting it up from the bottom of the bowl, turning and swirling to make sure each strand is coated with creamy sauce. The pasta should be soft and slithery; if it seems dry or too sticky, add a little more of the cooking water and toss again. Serve."
