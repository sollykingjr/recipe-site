Discard the pits and add the flesh to the bowl.- Tear 1 tablespoon oregano leaves in half as you add them to the bowl. Let the shallot and garlic sit in the dressing to macerate while you prep the salad\u2014the dressing will only improve with time.",
    "2. Prep the veg:- Trim the ends of 2 English (hothouse) cucumbers. Cut the cucumbers into 2-inch(ish) spears by making bias cuts, rotating the cucumber a quarter turn, making another bias cut, rotating again, etc., etc.- Slice 2 Fuyu persimmons crosswise into \u215b-inch-thick rounds, discarding the stem and root ends. Cut the persimmon rounds in half to create half-moons.- Cut 2 (4-ounce) blocks of feta crosswise into thin planks.",
    "3. Combine and serve:- Add the cukes and persimmons to the dressing and toss gently with your hands. Season with salt. Divide the salad among 4 serving bowls, reserving some of the dressing that\u2019s accumulated at the bottom for drizzling.- Break the feta planks into smaller pieces and scatter them over each bowl. Drizzle the remaining dressing over each salad. Finish with a crank of black pepper and nestle a few stuffed grape leaves in each bowl (if desired)."
