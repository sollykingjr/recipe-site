  "directions": [
    "1 Heat a grill to high heat (or preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F).",
    "2 Finely chop 2 scallions, green and white parts; set aside. Place the corn and whole scallions on a large rimmed baking sheet; drizzle with the oil and season with salt and pepper.",
    "3 Grill the corn until deeply charred on all sides (the best way to do this is by letting the ears char without moving them, rotating only every few minutes or so), 8 to 10 minutes. Add the scallions and grill about a minute or two. (If using the oven, simply roast, turning occasionally, until the corn and scallions are golden brown and lightly charred, 15 to 20 minutes. The corn will never char as if it had been grilled, but this is okay; get as much color as possible.) Let corn cool slightly.",
    "4 Using a sharp knife, remove the kernels from the corn and place in a large bowl along with the lime juice, tomatillos, and cilantro. Coarsely chop the charred scallions and add to the corn along with the remaining raw chopped scallions. Toss to coat and season with salt and pepper.",
    "5 Transfer to a large bowl or serving platter, top with more cilantro and avocado, if desired, and drizzle with olive oil."
