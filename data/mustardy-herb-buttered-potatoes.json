  "directions": [
    "1. Place the potatoes in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Generously salt the water, reduce the heat to medium to maintain a simmer, and cook until the potatoes are just cooked through and fork-tender, 12 to 15 minutes. (Maintaining a simmer instead of a rapid boil ensures even cooking.)2. Drain the potatoes into a colander, and set aside.3. Dry the pot, set over low heat, and add the butter to melt. Add both mustards and the honey, and stir until smooth.4. Remove from the heat, and add the potatoes, dill, chives, and parsley. Gently toss to coat the potatoes.5. Season with salt and pepper, and serve."
