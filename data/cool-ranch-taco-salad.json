  "directions": [
    "MAKE THE DRESSING: In a screw-top jar, shake to mix the oil, ketchup, vinegar, sugar, salt, and cayenne.",
    "MAKE THE BEEF MIXTURE: Heat a large dry skillet over high heat until really hot. Put the whole ears of corn in the pan and DFWI (Don\u2019t F*ck With It!!) until the underside is charred, about 3 minutes. Keep cooking, turning two more times, until the corn is charred in spots all over, 8 to 9 minutes. Remove to a plate. (If using thawed frozen kernels, char them in the dry skillet in a single layer, only stirring once or twice, until slightly blackened, about 6 minutes.)",
    "Let the pan cool a bit. Add the oil and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering-hot. Add the meat, breaking it up, until cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes.",
    "Drain most of the liquid from the pan but leave enough to keep the meat juicy. In a small bowl, combine the paprika, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, cayenne, salt, and black pepper. Add the spice mixture to the meat along with the black beans and \u00bd cup water. Cook, stirring gently, 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, let cool slightly, and stir in the cilantro.",
    "MAKE THE SALAD: Arrange the lettuce in a big salad bowl and top with the beef-bean mixture. Cut the corn from the cobs and add it to the salad with the tomatoes, avocado, and olives (if using). Pour the dressing over the salad and crumble the chips all over the top. Sprinkle with the onion and top with the sour cream."
