  "directions": [
    "1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Combine garlic, 1 tablespoon vinegar, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper in large bowl. Add chicken, toss to coat, and cover; let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.",
    "2. While chicken marinates, heat 1 tablespoon oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and bell pepper and cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in 2 tablespoons cilantro.",
    "3. Push vegetables to side of pot and increase heat to medium-high. Add chicken, skin side down, to cleared area of pot and brown lightly, 2 to 4 minutes per side, reducing heat if chicken begins to burn. Stir in broth, tomato sauce, and water and bring to simmer. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes.",
    "4. Stir in rice, olives, capers, and remaining \u00be teaspoon salt and bring to simmer. Cover, transfer pot to oven, and cook, stirring often, until chicken registers 175 degrees, rice is tender, and liquid has been absorbed, about 30 minutes. (If pot appears dry and begins to scorch after 20 minutes, stir in additional \u00bc cup water.)",
    "5. Remove pot from oven and transfer chicken to cutting board; cover pot and set aside. Let chicken cool slightly, then shred chicken into large chunks using 2 soupspoons; discard skin and bones. Toss chicken chunks, pimentos, remaining 2 teaspoons vinegar, remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro in clean bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "6. Place chicken on top of rice, cover, and let stand until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges."
