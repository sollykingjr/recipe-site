    "1. Put the cashews in a small heatproof bowl and add boiling water to cover. Set aside.",

    "3. In a blender, combine the center piece of the orange (no waste!), the lime juice, \u00bc cup of the cilantro, the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, and sriracha. Drain the cashews and add them to the blender with \u00bd cup cool water. Blend until smooth, adding a bit more water if it\u2019s too thick.",
    "4. Pour this dressing over the cabbage and stir to combine. Tear in the remaining cilantro and all the mint.",
    "5. Cut the tofu into 1-inch-thick squares and press out any moisture (see this page). In a large bowl, gently toss the tofu pieces with the sesame oil and a pinch of salt.",
    "6. Set a large pan over medium heat and add enough avocado oil to coat the bottom. Bring the oil up to 325\u00b0F and pan-fry the tofu pieces for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. When the tofu is finished remove it from the pan, turn the heat to medium-low, add the sesame seeds, and toast until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.",
    "7. Pile the salad into a bowl, add the tofu on top, and garnish with the toasted sesame seeds and a few mint and cilantro leaves."
