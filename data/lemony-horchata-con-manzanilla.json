  "ingredients": [
    "1lemon, peel scrubbed",
    "1\u00bdcups (285 g) long-grain white rice",
    "4cups (960 ml) filtered water",
    "\u00bccup (50 g) food-safe dried chamomile flowers",
    "1\u00bdcups (360 ml) oat milk",
    "\u00bdcup (100 g) sugar",
    "Pinch of sea salt",
    "Lemon peel twists, for garnish (optional)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Using a vegetable peeler, shave just the top layer of the bright yellow lemon peel into strips, working with light pressure to avoid the bitter white pith underneath.",
    "In a high-speed blender, add the lemon peel, rice, and 2 cups (480 ml) water and pulse a few times to break up the grains. Add another 2 cups (480 ml) water and blend for about 1 minute, until the lemon peel is reduced to specks and the rice grains are quite small, but the mixture is not completely smooth. (Leaving some texture in the grains will help keep the end result from being overly starchy.)",
    "Transfer the grain mixture to a large bowl, add the chamomile flowers, cover, and let sit at room temperature for at least 6 hours, ideally overnight.",
    "Set a fine-mesh strainer over a pitcher and strain the mixture, pressing gently on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Add the oat milk, sugar, and salt and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Chill the horchata for at least 3 hours. Serve over ice with lemon peel twists for garnish, if you like."
