  "ingredients": [
    "3tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "2large shallots, minced",
    "2garlic cloves, minced",
    "2ears fresh sweet corn, kernels removed (about 2 cups/365 g kernels)",
    "Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste",
    "8ounces (227 g/1 cup) dry orzo",
    "3cups (720 ml) unsalted chicken broth, homemade or store-bought, at room temperature",
    "3ounces (85 g) mascarpone",

  "directions": [
    "1. Heat the butter in a large pot over medium-low heat until melted. Add the shallots and garlic, and cook until softened, 3 or 4 minutes.2. Add the corn, and cook until it starts to soften, 2 or 3 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper.3. Add the orzo, and stir to coat it in the butter. Add about 1 cup (240 ml) chicken broth, and cook, stirring frequently while scraping the bottom of the pan, until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.4. Add another 1 cup (240 ml) broth, and continue to cook, stirring frequently while scraping the bottom, until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.5. Repeat with the last 1 cup (240 ml) broth, and cook until the orzo is al dente, most of the broth has been absorbed, and the mixture has a loose, stew-y risotto texture, 15 to 20 minutes. Maintain a simmer (not a full boil) throughout this process so the pasta cooks gently and the liquid doesn\u2019t all cook off before the pasta is able to absorb it and cook through.6. Reduce the heat to low, and stir in the mascarpone and pecorino Romano. Season with salt and pepper.7. Garnish with more pecorino Romano, a pinch of chile flakes, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and serve."
