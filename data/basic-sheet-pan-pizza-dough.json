  "directions": [
    "1. The day before (or up to 3 days before) you want to make a pizza, prepare the dough: Whisk the flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl until fully combined. Add the water, and mix. The dough will look lumpy, but there should be no dry pockets of flour.",
    "2. Cover with plastic wrap, and let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.",
    "3. Uncover the dough. Using damp hands, stretch and fold it: Gently pick up the north side of the dough, stretching it until you feel resistance, and fold it over to the south side of the bowl. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees, and repeat three times, until four sides have been stretched and folded.",
    "4. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for another 30 minutes.",
    "5. Repeat the folding process from step 3.",
    "6. Drizzle the top of the dough with a bit of olive oil, and cover with plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator to rest for at least 8 hours or up to 3 days.",
    "7. See the steps for forming and baking the pizza."
