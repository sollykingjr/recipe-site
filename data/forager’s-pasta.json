  "directions": [
    "1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Trim and tear the caps of 1 pound mushrooms (cremini, shiitake, maitake) into bite-size pieces. Drain and rinse 1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas. Peel 2 wide strips of zest from 1 lemon. Cut 8 tablespoons butter (1 stick) into 8 pieces and stick it back in the fridge.",
    "2. In a large skillet or Dutch oven (preferably one with a light-colored bottom), heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Add the mushrooms and chickpeas, season with S&P, and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until browned, 10 to 15 minutes.",
    "3. Now forage for your herbs and spices. Pick up to four of these ingredients: Coarsely smash or grind 1 teaspoon black peppercorns or fennel seeds. Break 1 cinnamon stick in half, or ready a whole nutmeg for dusting. Gather 8 sage leaves, 4 bay leaves, 3 thyme sprigs, or 2 rosemary sprigs.",
    "4. When the mushrooms and chickpeas are just about done, add 12 ounces short, ridged or curly pasta (mezzi rigatoni, gemelli, cavatelli) to the boiling water and cook until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain.",
    "5. When the mushrooms and chickpeas are ready, add the butter around the edges of the pan, then add the herbs, spices, and lemon peel. Season with S&P and cook, stirring, until the butter is golden and foaming, 1 or 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the juice from the lemon (about 3 tablespoons).",
    "6. Add the pasta to the skillet and return to medium-high. Cook, stirring and adding dribbles of pasta water, until the noodles are coated in sauce. Season to taste with S&P. Pluck out the branches, peels, and sticks as you come across them"
