  "ingredients": [
    "1large or 2 medium white onions",
    "5tablespoons olive oil",
    "salt",
    "about 1 pound flat green beans",
    "about 1\u00bc pounds ripe tomatoes or canned plum tomatoes",
    "a small handful of torn basil leaves"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Thinly slice the onion. Warm the oil in a heavy-bottomed pan with a lid over medium-low heat, then add the onion and cook gently with a pinch of salt until soft and translucent.",
    "Cut or break the beans into 2-inch lengths. Add the beans to the pan and stir well until each piece is glistening with oil. Continue cooking and stirring for a few minutes. Peel the tomatoes, if you like (by plunging them into boiling water for 60 seconds, then transferring to cold water, by which point the skins should split and slip off easily), then coarsely chop them and add to the pan with another pinch of salt. Stir, then cover the pan. After a couple of minutes, uncover the pan and stir; the tomatoes should be relinquishing their juices. Cover and cook for another 5 minutes or so.",
    "Once the tomatoes have given up their juices, uncover the pan and allow it to simmer, uncovered, stirring every now and then, for 40\u201350 minutes, or until the beans are tender and the tomatoes have reduced to a thick, rich sauce. During the last 10 minutes of cooking, add the ripped basil leaves. Taste and season with salt if necessary. Allow the dish to sit for a couple of hours before serving. It\u2019s even better made a day in advance, kept in the fridge overnight, and then brought to room temperature before serving."
