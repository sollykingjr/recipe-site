    "2pounds (907 g) fresh or frozen berries, such as blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, or quartered strawberries",
    "2cups (400 g) granulated sugar",
    "2tablespoons chopped hearty herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, tarragon, or sage",

  "directions": [
    "1. Add the berries, sugar, herbs, lemon juice, lemon halves, and salt to a large bowl, and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate overnight (at least 8 and up to 24 hours) to let the berries macerate and the flavors infuse.2. The next day, transfer the mixture, lemon halves and all, to a medium pot over medium heat. Cook, stirring, while also mashing up the berries with a wooden spoon, until the mixture comes to a soft boil, about 8 minutes.3. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue to cook and stir occasionally, until the berries are broken down, the mixture is thick, and the temperature reads 220\u00b0F (104\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer, 35 to 45 minutes. You can also check the jam for doneness by placing a small amount on a freezer-cold plate and running your finger through it. If the jam holds the part and looks a bit wrinkled on the surface, it should be good to go! Skim off any foam from the top of the jam that may form during the cooking process.4. Remove the pot from the heat, and let the jam cool to room temperature. Remove and discard the lemon halves.5. Serve, or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 months."
