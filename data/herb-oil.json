  "ingredients": [
    "2cups tender fresh herbs, such as parsley, basil, cilantro, chives",
    "1\u00bdcups avocado oil",
    "1teaspoon champagne vinegar",
    "Diamond Crystal kosher salt"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Prepare a large bowl of ice water and set it to the side.",
    "Set a large pot over high heat and bring 2 quarts salted water to a boil. Using tongs, submerge the herbs in the boiling water for 30 to 45 seconds. You\u2019ll see them start to turn a bright green. Transfer the herbs from the boiling water to the ice bath.",
    "When they are cool enough to handle, squeeze out any excess moisture and add the herbs and avocado oil to a blender. Blend until very smooth; this takes me 1 to 3 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, using a spoon to press out as much liquid green as possible. Whisk in the vinegar and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks."
