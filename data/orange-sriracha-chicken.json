    "Chicken:",
    "10chicken drumsticks (about 3\u00bd pounds)",
    "2teaspoons kosher salt (but remember: not all kosher salts are the same: I use Diamond Crystal brand\u2014if you\u2019re using Morton\u2019s kosher salt, use 1 to 1\u00bd teaspoons instead)",
    "Marinade:",
    "1medium yellow onion, roughly chopped",
    "1cup fresh basil leaves, packed",
    "\u00bdcup orange juice",
    "4cloves garlic, roughly chopped",
    "1tablespoon fish sauce",
    "1tablespoon balsamic vinegar",
    "1teaspoon tomato paste",
    "\u00bdteaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
    "Orange Sriracha Sauce:",
    "\u00bdcup orange juice",
    "2tablespoons honey",
    "1tablespoon Paleo Sriracha (hey, hotheads: you can add more, but just know that you\u2019ll be reducing the sauce and therefore concentrating the heat)",
    "1tablespoon ghee",
    "1teaspoon coconut aminos",
    "1teaspoon toasted sesame seeds (optional)",
    "Kosher salt"

  "directions": [
    "Here\u2019s what you do:",
    "In a large bowl, sprinkle the salt on the chicken, and set aside.",
    "To make the marinade, toss the onion, basil, orange juice, garlic, fish sauce, balsamic vinegar, tomato paste, and pepper in a food processor or high-powered blender.",
    "Pur\u00e9e until smooth.",
    "Pour the mixture over the chicken, making sure that all the drumsticks are well-coated.",
    "Cover and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for at least an hour and up to 12 hours.",
    "When you\u2019re ready to cook, take the bowl of chicken out of the fridge and preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Place a wire rack on top of a foil-lined baking sheet.",
    "Transfer the drumsticks to the wire rack. Spoon some extra marinade onto each piece of chicken. Bake for 40 minutes or until cooked through and the skin is golden brown, flipping each piece and turning the baking sheet at the halfway point.",
    "While the chicken\u2019s in the oven, make the Orange Sriracha Sauce. In a small saucepan, stir together the orange juice, honey, sriracha, ghee, and coconut aminos.",
    "Cook over high heat. Once it\u2019s at a boil, turn down the heat to low, and reduce the sauce until it\u2019s thickened (about 3 to 5 minutes).",
    "Taste and\u2014if necessary\u2014season with salt to taste.",
    "After 40 minutes in the oven\u2026",
    "\u2026brush a thin layer of the Orange Sriracha Sauce on each drumstick, and then roast for 5 more minutes.",
    "Then, take the tray out of the oven\u2026",
    "\u2026and use a brush to glaze the chicken with the remaining sauce.",
    "If desired, add a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds.",
    "The marinade gives these chicken drumsticks a rich, herby under-layer of flavor, while the spicy sriracha and sweet, citrusy notes of the sauce provide a tongue-tingling balance to this umami-packed dish."
