  ],
  "directions": [
    "Heat a large skillet with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. Add the sausage, if using, and cook, turning occasionally, until cooked through, about 12 minutes (or according to the directions on the package). Remove the sausage from the skillet, cut into 1-inch lengths, place in a large bowl, and set aside.",
    "Melt the butter in the skillet over medium-low heat, then add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden and translucent, about 9 minutes. While the onion is cooking, pile the thawed spinach into the center of a big clean kitchen towel and roll up the towel. Over a bowl or the sink, twist the ends toward each other and keep twisting until you wring out as much liquid as humanly possible. (Or make someone else do this.)",
    "Transfer the spinach to the bowl with the sausage and add the onion, bagel chunks, tomatoes, basil, Parm, 1 cup each of the Gruy\u00e8re and cheddar, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and \u00bd teaspoon of the pepper. Toss it all together with your hands or a spoon. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, half-and-half, mustard, cayenne, and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and \u00bd teaspoon black pepper.",
    "Grease a 9 \u00d7 13-inch baking dish with butter and arrange the bagel mixture in the dish. Pour the egg mixture over the top, pressing down on the bagels so they soak up the liquid. Nestle the cream cheese chunks in all around the pan (they can be peeking out). Cover and refrigerate for at least 1\u00bd hours and up to 12 hours. (The longer you soak, the moister the inside will be.)",
    "Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.",
    "Uncover the dish and sprinkle with the remaining \u00bd cup each Gruy\u00e8re and cheddar. Bake for 15 minutes, reduce the temperature to 350\u00b0F, and bake until the top is golden and the center is set, 50 minutes to 1 hour."
