  "ingredients": [
    "2teaspoons / 6 g active dry yeast",
    "4 \u00bdteaspoons / 19 g granulated sugar",
    "1 \u00bccups / 300 ml warm water (you may need \u00b1 \u00bc cup /60 ml more)",
    "3 \u00bdcups / 440 g bread flour or high gluten flour (you may need up to 1/2 cup / 60g for kneading)",
    "1 \u00bdteaspoons / 6 g salt",
    "Optional Toppings: (Refer to Notes)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "In \u00bd cup /120ml of the warm water, pour in the sugar and yeast. Do not stir. Let it sit for five minutes, and then stir the yeast and sugar mixture until it all dissolves in the water.",
    "Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast and sugar mixture.",
    "Pour 1/3 cup / 80ml of warm water into the well. Mix and stir in the rest of the water (the scant 1/2 cup / 100ml that is remaining), as needed. Depending on where you live, you may need to add an additional couple tablespoons to about \u00bc cup/60ml of water. You want a moist and firm dough after you have mixed it.",
    "On a floured countertop, knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. Try working in as much flour as possible to form a firm and stiff dough.",
    "Lightly brush a large bowl with oil and turn the dough to coat. Cover the bowl with a damp dish towel. Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until the dough has doubled in size. Punch the dough down, and let it rest for another 10 minutes.",
    "Carefully divide the dough into 8 pieces (I used a scale to be extra precise, but it\u2019s not necessary). Shape each piece into a round. Now, take a dough ball, and press it gently against the countertop (or whatever work surface you\u2019re using) moving your hand and the ball in a circular motion pulling the dough into itself while reducing the pressure on top of the dough slightly until a perfect dough ball forms (as pictured). Repeat with 7 other dough rounds.",
    "Coat a finger in flour, and gently press your finger into the center of each dough ball to form a ring. Stretch the ring to about \u2153 the diameter of the bagel and place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. Repeat the same step with the remaining dough.",
    "After shaping the bagels and placing them on the cookie sheet, cover with a damp kitchen towel and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 425\u00baF / 220\u00baC / Gas Mark 7.",
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Reduce the heat. Use a slotted spoon or skimmer to lower the bagels into the water. Boil as many as you are comfortable with boiling. Once the bagels are in, it shouldn\u2019t take too long for them to float to the top (a couple seconds). Let them sit there for 1 minute, and then flip them over to boil for another minute. Extend the boiling times to 2 minutes each, if you\u2019d prefer a chewier bagel (results will give you a more New York-Style bagel with this option).",
    "If you want to add toppings to your bagels, do so as you take them out of the water. Alternatively, you can use an egg wash to get the toppings to stick before baking the bagels. You may want to use the \u201cOptional Toppings\u201d listed above to top the bagels. Use just one topping, or a combination to make your own Everything Bagel Seasoning.",
    "Once all the bagels have boiled (and have been topped with your choice of toppings), transfer them to an oiled or parchment-lined baking sheet.",
    "Bake for 20 - 25 minutes, or until golden brown (I usually err on the side of 20 minutes).",
    "Cool on a wire rack (Or, if you\u2019re impatient like I am, slice one of these babies open and spread on some of your favorite cream cheese or softened butter. Take a bite\u2026 Oh babyyy!)",
    "How hot should the water be to proof the yeast?",
    "The water should ideally be between 105F / 40.5C \u2013 115F / 46C.",
    "Can I prepare the bagel dough in my bread maker or KitchenAid / stand mixer?",
    "You can absolutely use either. For a stand mixer: use the hook attachment, and knead the dough on the lowest setting. Do this for 5 to 6 minutes until smooth and springy. If you\u2019re making a double batch, you might not be able to use your stand mixer for kneading\u2013 refer to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",
    "There\u2019s two factors that come into play here: the way the dough is handled and the water the dough is boiled in. Being gentle is crucial to the formation of smooth looking bagels. The less you handle it, the smoother it will be. If you squeeze the dough roughly, it\u2019ll turn out wrinkly. Like many folks, I bake these bagels a lot, and some batches come out smooth and gorgeous, and on bad days some come out wrinkly. It\u2019s all about how you handle the dough, but in the end- it always tastes amazing!",
    "When it comes to boiling, make sure the water is not at a rolling boil; this will also prevent them from looking rough.",
    "Yes! This will achieve a slightly sweeter and shinier product. Use about 1 teaspoon of barley malt in the dough and a generous tablespoon in the pot of boiling water. Because this is not easily found, I have not made it a required ingredient for the recipe. However, it does add a delicious taste. Alternatively, you can use a couple tablespoons of brown sugar and/ or honey in the boiling water to achieve a similar effect.",
    "Do the bagels need an eggwash before they go into the oven?",
    "I\u2019ve been told by bakers who live at a higher elevation that this recipe works well as is, however I know that high-altitude baking, especially with yeast, can be a headache as dough tends to rise about 25 to 50 percent quicker than at lower altitudes, so do keep that in mind.",
    "A sure-fire way to ensure that the finished product is not very dense would be to reduce the amount of yeast to 1 teaspoon and allow the dough to rise for the recommended time in the recipe. If the dough has doubled in size after 1-hour, it\u2019s good to start working with. If not, continue to let it rise, checking on it every 15 minutes until doubled in size. Your altitude, brand of flour, humidity, and room temperature are factors that would make the rising times vary.",
    "Can I make the bagels bigger?",
    "You can, just keep in mind that they will need longer to bake, so check on them every few minutes past the 20 minute mark until they are uniformly golden brown.",
    "Make Ahead and Storage",
    "How can I make the dough ahead of time? Can I refrigerate the dough over night?",
    "The best means of making the dough ahead of time would be to prepare it, cover its container with plastic wrap, and rest it over night in the refrigerator. This is called a cold-rise. I often do this and I love this method because it allows the dough to achieve a more complex flavor. If you are doing a cold rise, be sure to allow the dough about 1/2 hour to come to room temperature before working with it.",
    "Can I par-bake the bagels for later baking?",
    "Yes, you can bake them until they are a faint gold tinge (about 10-15 minutes). Cool the par-baked bagels completely before storing them in a resealable bag to be stored in the freezer. To be bake from frozen, bake the bagels for an additional 10-15 minutes, until soft and golden brown.",
    "Can I freeze the bagels? Do they keep well?",
    "Once cool, out of the oven, you can freeze the bagels without any issues. Slice them and then freeze them in a freezer-safe plastic bag, and let them thaw when needed. If you\u2019re planning on toasting them, thawing them is unnecessary.",
    "The bagels will keep in a resealable plastic bag at room temperature for up to 2 days."
