  "directions": [
    "roast the chickpeas Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Toss the chickpeas with the olive oil, salt, and cumin until they\u2019re all coated. Spread the chickpeas on a baking sheet or pan, and roast them in the oven until they\u2019re browned and crisp. This can take anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the size and firmness of your chickpeas. Toss them occasionally, to make sure they\u2019re toasting evenly. Set aside until needed.",
    "make the dressing Whisk all the ingredients together until smooth, adding more water if needed to thin the dressing slightly. Taste and adjust the seasoning; don\u2019t worry if the lemon juice makes it taste a little sharp; it will marry perfectly with the sweet grated carrots.",
    "assemble the salad Place the grated carrots in a large bowl, and toss them with the parsley. Mix in two-thirds of the dressing, adding more if desired. Add more salt and pepper if needed. Sprinkle with a large handful of chickpeas (you\u2019ll have extra, and if you\u2019re like us, you won\u2019t regret it) and the pistachios.",
    "do ahead The salad keeps well in the fridge for 2 days; however, I\u2019d add the chickpeas and pistachios right before serving, so they don\u2019t get soft."
