  "ingredients": [
    "6tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature",
    "\u00becup (145 grams) firmly packed dark-brown sugar",
    "2tablespoons (25 grams) granulated sugar",
    "1large egg",
    "1large egg yolk",
    "1teaspoon vanilla extract",
    "\u00becup (175 ml) buttermilk",
    "\u00bcteaspoon baking soda",
    "\u00beteaspoon baking powder",
    "\u00bdteaspoon table or fine sea salt",
    "\u00bdcup (40 grams) Dutch-process cocoa powder",
    "1cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat an 8-inch square cake pan with nonstick spray and line the bottom with parchment paper.",
    "Beat the butter and sugars together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Beat in the egg, yolk, and vanilla until combined, scrape down the bowl, and then sprinkle the baking powder, baking soda, and salt over the batter and beat until very well combined. Add the buttermilk and mix to combine; the batter may look curdly, but this isn\u2019t a problem. Add the cocoa and flour, and mix until the flour just disappears.",
    "Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out batter-free. Let cool in the pan on a cooling rack for 10 minutes, then run a knife around the cake to ensure it is loose, flip it out onto a cooling rack, and then flip back right side up again onto another. Let cool completely before frosting. You can hasten this process along in your freezer, where it shouldn\u2019t take more than 15 minutes to fully cool."
