    "2. Add the chilies, shrimp paste, and salt and process until a smooth paste forms, adding a few more ice cubes if needed (however, the goal is to add as little water or ice as possible), stopping several times to scrape the bottom and sides of the machine to ensure a smooth paste. It can take about 5 minutes for the smooth paste to form. Scrape into a container with a lid. The curry will last 5 days in the refrigerator and up to 3 months in the freezer."
