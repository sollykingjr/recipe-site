  "directions": [
    "1 Cook the rice in a pot of salted boiling water until just al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, rinse, and set aside.",
    "2 Heat the butter and olive oil in a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the almonds and cook, stirring, until fragrant and toasted and the butter has started to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the almonds to a small bowl, leaving all the butter behind, and season with salt.",
    "3 Add the turmeric and shallot to the skillet and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallot has softened but is not yet browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice and, using a spatula or wooden spoon, press the rice gently into the skillet, encouraging even contact all over. Cook, without disturbing the rice (feel free to rotate the skillet to prevent uneven cooking), until it\u2019s starting to brown nicely along the bottom (this will happen faster at the center of the skillet, so use a spatula to lift up the rice to check the progress), 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large serving platter, placing some of those crispier bits of rice on top, along with the cilantro, mint, dill, and almonds."
