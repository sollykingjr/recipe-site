  "directions": [
    "1 Make the salsa. Heat the oil, chiles, and garlic in a small pot over medium heat. Cook, swirling occasionally, until the chiles are toasted and the garlic is golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the peanuts, swirling to coat. Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor and pulse until coarsely pureed. Place in a bowl with the vinegar and add more oil as needed to create a spoonable sauce. Season with salt.2 Make the steak. Season the steak with salt and pepper; set aside. Place the onion in a bowl of ice water and let sit (this rinses away some of that raw onion-y bite).3 In a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the steak and cook until deeply, impossibly, golden brown on one side, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until golden brown on that side as well, another 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board to rest 5 to 10 minutes.4 Toss the watercress with the lime juice; season with salt and pepper. Slice the steak and serve alongside the onions, watercress, cilantro, lime wedges, chile-peanut salsa, and tortillas."
