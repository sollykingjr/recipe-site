  "directions": [
    "Get 2 inches of oil to 350\u00b0F in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Line a baking sheet with a wire rack or paper towels.",
    "Stir together the flour, salt, and black pepper in a medium mixing bowl. One at a time, put the crabs in the flour mixture and get in there with your hands to make sure they\u2019re totally coated, including underneath the pointy flaps on the top side. Give them a light shake, then move them to a plate.",
    "When the oil\u2019s ready, fry the crabs in batches, if necessary, so they don\u2019t crowd the oil, flipping once halfway through and adjusting the heat to keep the oil temp around 350\u00b0F, until they\u2019re crispy and the claws and legs are fried in place, 5 to 7 minutes. When they\u2019re done, use tongs to move them to the baking sheet and immediately and liberally sprinkle both sides with salt.",
    "Get a large well-seasoned cast-iron or nonstick skillet or griddle good and hot over medium heat. Swipe the butter generously on each side of the bread slices. Working in batches, cook the bread until both sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. When they\u2019re done, move them to a rack or stand them up so they lean against each other to keep from getting soggy.",
    "Generously swipe the tartar sauce on all eight slices of bread. Pile the shrettuce on four slices, perch the onions and jalape\u00f1os on top, and add your crabs. Squeeze that lemon juice all over the crabs, top with the rest of the bread, and sprinkle with Old Bay to give the tops a thin, even layer of fairy dust. Cut in half and eat.",
    "Malt Vinegar Tartar SauceGive the chopped pickle a quick pat with a paper towel. Put it in a bowl with the rest of the ingredients and mix it all up.",
    "It\u2019ll keep in the fridge for up to 10 days."
