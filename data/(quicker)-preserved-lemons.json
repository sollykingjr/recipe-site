  "ingredients": [
    "4whole lemons",
    "2leftover previously squeezed lemons (4 halves, in my case)",
    "Diamond Crystal kosher salt",
    "1whole clove"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Wash the whole lemons well and cut them in half. Juice the lemons and set the spent rinds aside (they should yield about \u2154 cup juice, but it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect). If you have less than \u00bd cup, juice another lemon to get to that amount.",
    "2. Set a medium pot over high heat and bring 2 quarts water to a boil. Add all the lemon halves and boil for 10 minutes to soften the rinds. Turn down the heat to keep the pot from boiling over.",
    "3. Scoop the lemons out of the water and divide them between two jars. It should be a snug fit.",
    "4. Return the water to a soft boil and add the lemon juice, \u2153 cup salt, and the clove. Let this boil until the salt dissolves. Turn off the heat and pour the brine over the lemons. Let the jars cool to room temperature before sealing and storing.",
    "5. Store in the fridge for at least 1 week before using, flipping the jars to rest upside down every few days to prevent the salt from settling. When they\u2019re ready, the lemons will function and taste exactly like preserved lemons. Store in the fridge for up to 1 month after they\u2019re ready for use."
