  "directions": [
    "marinate the chicken Combine the ingredients for the marinade, and pour into a large ziplock bag. Add the chicken, seal, and slosh it around so that it coats evenly. Let the chicken marinate in the fridge for 30 minutes or up to 2 days.",
    "cook the chicken Heat a large, deep skillet with a lid over medium-high heat. Coat lightly with olive or vegetable oil. Arrange the cutlets (usually three at a time) in one layer, and do not move them until they\u2019re brown and don\u2019t want to stick anymore, 5 to 8 minutes. Flip, and brown well on second side, which will take 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to a plate. Don\u2019t worry if they\u2019re not 100 percent cooked through yet; you\u2019re mostly prepping them so that when that line of nonpaying customers known as your family appears, you\u2019ll be able to finish the meat and have it hot. Repeat with remaining chicken, then wipe out the pan.",
    "make the rice Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan, and heat it, then add the spices and rice and toast together for a minute, stirring. Add the stock and salt, and bring to a simmer; then reduce the heat to its lowest setting, cover with a lid, and let cook for about 15 minutes, until the water has absorbed and the rice is tender. Let it rest for 3 to 5 minutes off the heat, then scoop onto half of a serving platter.",
    "While the rice cooks, make the sauce, combining all the ingredients in a medium bowl. Adjust seasonings to taste.",
    "Combine the lettuce, tomatoes, and onion in a large bowl to make the salad. Season with salt and pepper. The sauce will be your dressing.",
    "Stir the hot sauce and harissa together to make your hot sauce.",
    "to finish Chop the chicken into bite-sized, uneven pieces. The griddle guys do this with a bench scraper right on the griddle, but you can do it on your cutting board. Reheat the empty pan from the rice over medium-high, add a little olive or another oil, just to coat the pan lightly, and then add the chopped chicken. Cook, stirring and breaking up the meat with spatula into smaller pieces if desired, until it is fully cooked through, 2 to 4 more minutes. Add more salt to season, if desired. Scrape it on top of the rice.",
    "Pile the salad in the remaining part of the platter. Dress the dish with sauce, to taste, and garnish with cilantro. Serve with halved pitas.",
