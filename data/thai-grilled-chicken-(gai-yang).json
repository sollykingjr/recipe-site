    "2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil. Put the chickens on the baking sheet and rub the marinade all over them, including under the skin, too. Cover with foil and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours.",
    "3. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling. Preheat the grill to medium or a grill pan over medium heat. Dip the lemongrass stalks into the garlic oil and brush both sides of the chicken with some of the oil. Grill the chicken skin-side down for about 20 minutes, until the fat has rendered and the skin becomes crispy, basting with some of the oil every 5 minutes. Turn the chicken over and continue cooking and basting for about 15 minutes longer, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 155 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the chicken from the grill, loosely tent with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes before cutting."
