  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. To prepare the potato: The best way to get uniform pieces is to use a mandoline first to cut the potato lengthwise into \u00bc-inch / 6mm slices, then line up the slices into a stack and cut into thin strips with a cleaver.",
    "2. Soak the potato strips in a large bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight to get rid of the starch and to make it easier to stir-fry. Drain the potatoes and lay them out on kitchen towels to dry.",
    "3. In a large pan or wok over medium heat, warm the chili oil. Throw in the chilies, pepper, and garlic and saut\u00e9 quickly to release the aromatics into the oil, making sure not to burn the spices.",
    "4. Turn up the heat to high, add the potatoes and stir-fry for about 5 minutes, until the potatoes are still crisp but no longer taste raw.",
    "5. Season with the salt and sugar, add the vinegar and fish sauce, stirring to combine, then cover for another 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "6. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the sesame oil, and transfer to a serving plate. Serve hot!"
