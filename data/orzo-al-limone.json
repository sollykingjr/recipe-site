  "directions": [
    "1. Prep your aromatics:- Finely chop 1 yellow onion.- Using a vegetable peeler, peel 3 (3-inch-long) strips of lemon zest from 1 lemon; set the lemon aside.",
    "2. Start the orzo:- In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat 3 tablespoons butter over medium heat until melted and foamy.- Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until softened but not yet browned, 5 to 7 minutes.- Add 1 cup orzo, the 3 strips of lemon zest, and 1 teaspoon black pepper and toast, stirring, for 2 minutes.- Stir in 3 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Once the water comes to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally so the orzo doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pot, until most of the water has been absorbed (there should still be some liquid at the bottom of the pot), 6 to 8 minutes. Taste the orzo; it should be al dente but not crunchy.",
    "3. Finish the orzo:- Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in 2 tablespoons butter and 2\u00bd ounces grated Parmesan cheese (\u00be cup).- Finely grate the remaining zest of the lemon into the pot. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice of both halves into the orzo. Taste and add more salt as needed. Add a few more tablespoons of water, if needed, until it\u2019s very creamy and loose.",
    "4. Serve: Drizzle the orzo with olive oil and season with black pepper and more grated Parmesan."
