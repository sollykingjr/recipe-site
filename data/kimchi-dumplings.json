  "directions": [
    "1. MAKE THE FILLING: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and boil, stirring occasionally, until they\u2019re tender but still chewy, about 8 minutes. Drain well and use scissors to snip them into 1-inch pieces.",
    "2. Cut the tofu in half horizontally and press it between paper towels or a clean kitchen towel to remove excess liquid. Give the kimchi a gentle squeeze to drain off its liquid. Crumble the tofu into a medium mixing bowl, then add the noodles, kimchi, chives, gochugaru, sesame oil, and mushroom seasoning powder and mix well.",
    "3. FORM THE DUMPLINGS: Put a heaping teaspoon of the kimchi mixture in the center of each dumpling wrapper. Dip two fingers in water and rub the edges of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper corner to corner to make a triangle, then firmly press the edges together so they stick together. Keep them in the fridge\u2014in a single layer or with layers separated by parchment paper\u2014until you\u2019re ready to cook them, up to 12 hours.",
    "4. COOK THE DUMPLINGS: Combine the olive oil and sesame oil in a small mixing bowl and stir well. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the dumplings and cook for 2 minutes. Taste a dumpling to be sure the wrapper is cooked. Drain the dumplings, drizzle with the sesame oil mixture and some hot sauce, and serve right away."
