  "ingredients": [
    "1medium apple of choice, cut into bite-size pieces",
    "\u2154cup old-fashioned rolled oats",
    "\u00bdteaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "2large Medjool dates, pitted and torn into small pieces",
    "1teaspoon red miso paste"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. In a medium pot over medium-high heat combine the apple and \u00bc cup water. Bring to a simmer, then cover and turn the heat to medium-low. Cook until the apple is fork-tender but not falling apart, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the oats, 1\u2153 cups water, and the cinnamon and bring to a soft boil.",
    "2. Add the dates and miso paste and let the mixture thicken, stirring often, for 5 to 7 minutes. The dates will melt into the oats, almost disappearing, and the miso will dissolve. Press the miso into the oats with a spatula if it needs some encouragement.",
    "3. Remove from the heat and let it cool and thicken for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, as desired."
