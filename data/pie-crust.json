  "ingredients": [
    "2\u00bdcups all-purpose flour",
    "2teaspoons sugar",
    "1teaspoon kosher salt",
    "1\u00bccups (2 sticks plus 4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces, chilled",
    "1tablespoon apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar",
    "\u00bccup ice water, plus more as needed"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Whisk the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Using your hands, smash the butter between your palms and fingertips into the flour, creating long, thin, flaky bits. When most of it is incorporated and there are no large chunks remaining, dump the flour mixture onto a work surface.2 Combine the vinegar with the ice water and drizzle it over the flour. Using the tips of your fingers, run your hands through the flour mixture. Do this a few more times, until it all starts coming together.3 Using the palms of your hand, start kneading the dough, gathering up any dry bits from the bottom and placing them on the top to be incorporated. You can add 1, maybe 2 tablespoons water during this process if you feel the dough really needs it, but it should remain on the drier side (it will hydrate and become more tender as it rests).4 When you\u2019ve got a shaggy mass of dough (it will not be smooth and it certainly will not be shiny), knead it one or two more times, then divide in half. Pat each half into a flat disc, about 1 inch thick. Wrap each disc individually and refrigerate at least 2 hours."
