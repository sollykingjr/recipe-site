    "- \u00bc cup / 60ml Shaoxing wine",
    "- 2 Tbsp dark soy sauce",
    "- 1 Tbsp light soy sauce",
    "- 1 piece (about 2 oz / 60g) rock sugar",

    "- 1 or 2 pieces star anise",

  "directions": [
    "1. In a medium pot over high heat, bring some water to a boil and blanch the pork belly pieces for 2 to 3 minutes. In a colander, drain and rinse the pork with running water to remove all the scum and impurities from the meat. Set aside.",
    "2. In a wok or donabe over medium-high heat, add the oil, scallions, and pork belly and fry for a couple of minutes, until the scallions become fragrant and the pork is seared and golden brown. Add the wine, dark and light soy sauces, rock sugar, water, star anise, and cassia bark. The liquid should cover most of the pork, but don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s not all submerged. Bring the mixture to a boil and lower the heat to the lowest setting, cover, and cook for about 1 hour.",
    "3. At this point, the meat will be very tender, and your kitchen will smell incredible. Uncover the wok and turn up the heat to high. Once the liquid reaches a boil, it will start to reduce quickly, so pay close attention. Using a spatula, mix in the vinegar and chili crisp. After 1 to 2 minutes, the sauce will have reduced to a delicious thick consistency, coating the pieces of pork in a shiny, dark red elixir.",
    "4. Transfer the pork and sauce to a serving bowl or serve directly in the wok. You\u2019ll want to serve some rice with this dish to soak up the ridiculously decadent sauce and the rich chunks of fatty meat. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."
