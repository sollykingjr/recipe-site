    "\u00bd\u20131fresh red chili",
    "2\u00bdoz mixed brown & white crabmeat",
    "\u00bda lemon",
    "\u2153oz Cheddar cheese",
    "2large eggs"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Seed and finely chop the chili. Mix as much as you dare with the crabmeat, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a little sea salt and black pepper. Finely grate the cheese. Beat the eggs well, ready to go.",
    "Get a 12-inch non-stick frying pan nice and hot on a medium-high heat, then add a drizzle of olive oil and wipe it around and out with a ball of paper towel. Pour in the eggs, swirling them around the pan and up the sides. Working quickly, sprinkle over the cheese from a height, followed by the dressed crab, then turn the heat off. Use a rubber spatula to gently ease it away from the edges and quickly roll it up a few times \u2013 you want to create layers, so how you roll and whether it tears doesn\u2019t matter, just don\u2019t overcook it. Turn the omelet out onto a plate, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, and tuck in."
