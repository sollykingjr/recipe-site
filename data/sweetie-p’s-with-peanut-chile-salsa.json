  "ingredients": [
    "PRODUCE",
    "4small sweet potatoes (about 2 pounds total)",
    "2garlic cloves",
    "2limes",
    "PANTRY",
    "\u00bdcup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "Kosher salt",
    "\u00bdcup roasted, unsalted peanuts",
    "1tablespoon ancho chile powder or sweet paprika",
    "1teaspoon honey",
    "\u00bdteaspoon red pepper flakes"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.",
    "2. Roast the sweet potatoes:- Scrub 4 small sweet potatoes, then pat them dry. Cut the sweet potatoes in half lengthwise. Place on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with 1\u00bd teaspoons salt, tossing with your hands to evenly coat. Arrange cut-sides down. Transfer to the oven and roast until tender when pierced with a knife and charred on the undersides, 25 to 35 minutes. Transfer the roasted sweet potatoes to a platter.",
    "3. Meanwhile, make the peanut-chile salsa:- Finely chop \u00bd cup peanuts so that all pieces are about the size of a lentil. Place in a small pot and cover with \u00bd cup olive oil. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the peanuts are golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.- Finely grate 2 garlic cloves right into the oil while it\u2019s still relatively hot, stirring to combine. This will cook off some of the raw heat of the garlic and mellow out its flavor. Stir in 1 tablespoon ancho chile powder, 1 teaspoon honey, \u00bd teaspoon red pepper flakes, and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Cover to keep warm.- Cut 2 limes into 4 wedges each.",
    "4. Serve:- Spoon the peanut-chile salsa over the sweet potatoes and serve with the lime wedges for squeezing."
