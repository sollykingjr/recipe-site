  "ingredients": [
    "\u2154cup strong espresso coffee, still warm",
    "2tablespoons dark rum or brandy",
    "\u00bdcup plus 1 tablespoon superfine sugar",
    "3eggs",
    "\u2153cup Marsala",
    "8\u00beounces mascarpone",
    "12ladyfinger cookies",
    "good-quality unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Mix the espresso with the rum and 2\u00bd tablespoons of the sugar and stir until the sugar has dissolved.",
    "Separate the eggs, putting the yolks in one bowl and the whites in another. Add the Marsala and remaining sugar to the egg yolks and whisk until the mixture is light and fluffy before adding the mascarpone and stirring it in carefully. Whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Gently but firmly, fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture with a metal spoon.",
    "For each tumbler you will need 2 ladyfingers. Submerge a ladyfinger into the coffee mixture until it is sodden but not collapsing. Gently break it in half and tuck half in the base of the glass. Spoon over a tablespoon of the mascarpone cream before placing the other half of the biscuit on top and covering it with another spoonful of cream. Using a fine-mesh sieve, dust the surface with cocoa powder. Take another biscuit, soak it as before, break it in half, and place both halves side by side on top of the cocoa-dusted mascarpone cream. Cover the surface with more cream.",
    "Repeat this process with the other 5 tumblers. Keep them in the fridge for at least 8 hours before eating, so that they are absolutely set. Before serving, dust the surface of each one very liberally with more cocoa powder. Eat."
