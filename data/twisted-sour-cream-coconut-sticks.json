  "ingredients": [
    "- \u2154 cup sour cream",
    "- 1 large egg yolk",
    "- 1\u00bd cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling out the dough",
    "- \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt",
    "- \u00bd pound (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces",
    "- 1 cup sugar",
    "- \u2154 cup finely shredded dried unsweetened coconut"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Whisk together the sour cream and egg yolk in a small bowl.",
    "2. Combine the 1\u00bd cups flour and the salt in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix for seconds. Add the butter and mix until the mixture looks like coarse sand. Add the sour cream mixture and mix until just combined.",
    "3. Scrape the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and form into a disk. Wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours.",
    "4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let sit for 5 minutes.",
    "5. Lightly dust a work surface with flour and roll out the dough to a \u00bc-inch thickness. Sprinkle the top of the dough with the sugar and roll again to make sure the sugar adheres to the dough and to make the dough slightly thinner.",
    "6. Sprinkle the dough with the coconut and roll again as for the sugar. Using a sharp knife, cut the dough into a 12 \u00d7 12-inch square and cut into 8 equal strips. Hold each strip of dough by the ends, stretch it to the length of the baking sheet, twist it, and transfer to the prepared baking sheet; refrigerate for 15 minutes to chill.",
    "7. Remove from the refrigerator and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool completely on a wire rack. These can be made up to 1 day ahead and stored in an airtight container."
