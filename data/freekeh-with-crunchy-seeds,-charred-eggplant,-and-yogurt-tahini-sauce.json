  "directions": [
    "Rinse the freekeh a few times in a bowl of cool water until the water runs clear. Transfer to a medium pot, pour in the boiling water, and add the salt. Bring the water back to a rapid boil and cook until the grains are tender but still have a little bit of bite, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a colander and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking. Set aside.",
    "Line a plate with paper towels. Heat about 1\u00bd tablespoons of the oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the pumpkin seeds, reduce the heat to medium-low, and fry, shaking the skillet and stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Add the pine nuts and sunflower seeds and fry for another minute. Remove from the heat as soon as the pine nuts start to change their color to golden. Spread the contents of the skillet over the paper towels to drain. Strain the oil and set aside.",
    "Combine the freekeh with the nuts and seeds in a large bowl. Pour in the remaining 1\u00bd tablespoons oil and the oil reserved from frying the seeds. Add the barberries and 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice, season with salt, and toss to combine. Taste again and adjust the seasoning.",
    "Peel the eggplant or slit it open and scoop out the flesh. Coarsely chop the flesh and pile it into a large bowl. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice (this will make the color lighter) and add the jalape\u00f1o and sauce. Mix thoroughly.",
    "Spread the eggplant on a serving plate, leaving a well in the center. Mound the freekeh salad in the well, and scatter on some cilantro leaves. Serve right away."
