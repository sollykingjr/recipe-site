    "MAIN",
    "185g canned tuna (6.5 ounces), oil or water drained",
    "50g mixed vegetables (1.7 ounces), sweet corn, baby peas, capsicum / bell peppers or carrots, cut into small pieces as necessary (you can use frozen or tinned ones too.)",
    "20g onion (0.7 ounces), diced",
    "1Tbsp cooking oil , I used rice bran oil",
    "1tsp toasted sesame seeds to garnish",
    "2Tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste)",
    "1/4cup tomato sauce / ketchup",
    "1Tbsp honey"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Heat up a skillet over medium high heat. Once heated, add the cooking oil and the tuna. Stir quickly. Add the vegetables and the spicy tuna sauce and mix them well so that everything is coated with the sauce. (If you make the spicy tuna sauce from option 2 to serve over rice or pasta, only add half of the sauce so that the remainder can be used later - over rice/pasta.) Add the sesame seeds. Remove from the heat."
