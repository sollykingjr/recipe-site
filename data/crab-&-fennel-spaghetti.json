Halve the tomatoes and toss into the pan for 2 minutes, followed by the crabmeat and, 1 minute later, the drained pasta. Loosen with a splash of reserved cooking water, if needed, then season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, sprinkle over any reserved fennel tops, and drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Enjoy."
