  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold water, using your fingers to agitate the rice, until the water runs almost clear. (Alternatively, place the rice in a pot or bowl and rinse and drain away the water three times.)",
    "2 Transfer the rice to a 1\u00bd-quart enamel-glazed cast-iron pot (or similarly sized saucepan or donabe) and add the soy sauce, mirin, sake, and 1\u00bc cups water. Sprinkle the katsuobushi, if using, over the top. Let the rice soak for at least 20 minutes or up to 1 hour.",
    "3 Once the rice has soaked, separate the mushrooms from one another and add them to the pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking or clumping. Then cover the pot, drop the heat to low, and set a timer for 14 minutes. (While the rice cooks, you can prepare the garnishes.)",
    "4 After 14 minutes, uncover the rice and fluff with a fork or spoon. Cover again and let stand for 5 minutes before stirring in the garnishes and serving."
