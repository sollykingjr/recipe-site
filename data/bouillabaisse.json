  "directions": [
    "1  For the fish and shellfish marinade  Combine all ingredients in large bowl and toss until fish is thoroughly coated with herbs and oil. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours.",
    "2  For the fish stock  Meanwhile, heat oil in 8-quart stockpot or Dutch oven over medium-low heat until shimmering. Add onions, fennel, and carrot to pot, cover, and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are fragrant, about 15 minutes. Place garlic in large zipper-lock bag and seal. Smash garlic with rolling pin or meat pounder until flattened. Add smashed garlic to vegetables and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are dry and just beginning to stick, about 15 minutes longer. (Take care not to let garlic burn.) Add wine and stir to scrape pot bottom, then add tomatoes and their juice, fish frames, leeks, water, shrimp shells, parsley stems, thyme sprig, bay leaves, peppercorns, and salt. Bring to simmer over medium-high heat, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, pressing down on fish bones occasionally with wooden spoon to submerge, until stock is rich and flavorful, about 1 hour.",
    "3  Strain stock through large fine-mesh strainer (you should have about 9 cups); rinse and wipe out pot and return strained stock to pot. Bring stock to boil over high heat and simmer briskly until reduced to 8 cups, about 10 minutes. Off heat, add orange zest and saffron. Let stand for 10 minutes to infuse flavors. Strain stock through fine-mesh strainer and set aside. (Stock can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month and then defrosted.)",
    "4  For the stew  Return fish stock to clean 8-quart pot and bring to rolling boil over high heat. Stir in mussels and marinated fish and shellfish, cover pot, and return to simmer; simmer for 7 minutes, stirring a few times to ensure even cooking. Remove pot from heat, cover, and let stand until fish is cooked through and mussels have opened, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste, ladle into bowls, and float 1 crouton topped with dollop of rouille in each bowl. Serve."
