  "ingredients": [
    "1cup whole milk (8 oz / 227g)",
    "1\u00bdteaspoons active dry yeast (0.18 oz / 5g)",
    "4\u00bdcups all-purpose flour (20.6 oz / 585g), plus more for the work surface and bowl",
    "\u2153cup sugar (2.3 oz / 66g)",
    "1\u00bdteaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt (0.16 oz / 5g)",
    "10tablespoons unsalted butter (5 oz / 142g), cut into 1-inch pieces, chilled",
    "3large eggs (5.3 oz / 150g)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Warm the milk and proof the yeast: In a small saucepan, gently warm the milk over low heat, swirling the pan, just until it\u2019s lukewarm to the touch but not hot (about 105\u00b0F on an instant-read thermometer). Pour about \u00bc cup of the warm milk (2 oz / 57g) into a small bowl and whisk in the yeast until it\u2019s dissolved. Let the yeast mixture sit until it\u2019s foamy, about 5 minutes.",
    "Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and butter and toss to coat the butter pieces. Make a well in the center of the bowl and pour in the eggs, yeast mixture, and remaining warm milk. Set the bowl on the mixer and attach the dough hook. Mix on low speed until all the flour is moistened, then increase to medium and continue to mix until the butter is incorporated (the warm milk will soften it eventually) and you have a soft, sticky dough, about 5 minutes. Stop the mixer, scrape down the sides of the bowl, then mix on medium-high until the dough pulls cleanly away from the sides, gathers almost completely around the hook, and is very smooth and supple, about 5 minutes longer. It will still be very soft and might start to stick to the bowl when the mixer is at a lower speed, but if the dough sticks on medium-high then add more flour by the tablespoon until it pulls away and is slightly tacky but no longer sticky.",
    "Proof the dough and then chill: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gather it into a ball. Dust the dough all over with a bit more flour, then place inside a medium bowl. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature until it\u2019s about 50 percent expanded in size, 1 to 1\u00bd hours. Transfer the bowl to the refrigerator where the dough will finish the first rise, eventually doubling. Chill until cold, at least 4 hours, though 8 to 12 is better (not only will refrigerating the dough make it firmer and easier to handle, it will improve the flavor as well)."
