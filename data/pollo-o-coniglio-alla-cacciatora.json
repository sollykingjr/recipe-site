  "ingredients": [
    "1(3\u00bc\u20134\u00bd-pound) chicken or rabbit",
    "5tablespoons olive oil",
    "2garlic cloves",
    "1chile pepper, or 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes",
    "a sprig of rosemary",
    "1cup white wine, plus extra if needed",
    "salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "1tablespoon red wine vinegar",
    "a handful of pitted black olives"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Cut the chicken or rabbit into 12 pieces (I ask my butcher to do this). In a deep saut\u00e9 pan or casserole dish with a lid that\u2019s large enough to fit the meat in a snug single layer, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the meat pieces, skin-side down, and cook until the skin forms a golden crust, then turn them over and do the same on the other side. This will take about 20 minutes.",
    "While the meat is browning, very finely chop the garlic, chile, and leaves from the rosemary sprig. Once the meat has browned, sprinkle in the chopped garlic, chile, and rosemary, pour over the white wine, season with salt and pepper, cover the pan, and turn the heat down to low. Cook the meat, turning from time to time, until the thighs feel very tender when prodded with a fork and the meat is surrounded by a thick gravy. This will take anywhere from 45 minutes to 1\u00bc hours, depending on the chicken (or rabbit). If the pan seems dry, add a little more wine. In the last minutes of cooking, add the vinegar and olives, stir, and divide among warmed dishes."
