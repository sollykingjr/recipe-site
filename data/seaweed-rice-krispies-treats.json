    "FOR THE TREATS",
    "- \u00bc cup plus 2 tablespoons unsalted vegan butter, plus a thin layer for the pan",
    "- \u00bd teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
    "- 8 ounces (about 2\u00bc cups) vegan mini marshmallows",
    "- 5 cups vegan crispy rice cereal",
    "- 1\u00bd teaspoons toasted sesame seeds",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "MAKE THE TREATS:- LINE a 9 \u00d7 13-inch baking/casserole dish with parchment paper and rub on a thin layer of vegan butter.- POUR an inch or so of water into a medium saucepan, bring it to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Set a large heatproof mixing bowl in the saucepan, add the vegan butter and vanilla, and let the vegan butter melt completely. Fold in the marshmallows and cook, stirring occasionally, until the marshmallows lose their shape and become stretchy, 5 to 7 minutes. The butter won\u2019t fully mix with the marshmallows, and that\u2019s OK. Take the bowl off the heat and fold in the cereal to coat it as well as you can in the mixture.- POUR the mixture into the casserole dish and press into an even layer. Let it cool. Cut into 16 squares, transfer to a platter, and garnish with the sesame seeds, aonori, and kizami nori."
