  "ingredients": [
    "- 12 scallions, trimmed",
    "- \u00bc cup grapeseed or another neutral oil",
    "- 2 cups sliced (\u00bd inch) white onion",
    "- 1-inch knob ginger, sliced",
    "- 8 ounces dried shiitake",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "PUT the scallions on a work surface and use the flat of a chef\u2019s knife blade to firmly whack the whites to smash them. Cut the scallions into 2-inch pieces.",
    "HEAT 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Add the scallions, stir to coat in the oil, and cook, stirring once or twice, until they begin to char at the edges, about 1 minute. Transfer the scallions to a plate, add the rest of the oil, and cook the onion the same way, 1 to 2 minutes. Return the scallions to the pot.",
    "ADD 16 cups water, ginger, mushrooms, and mushroom seasoning powder, cover, and let it come to a boil, skimming off any froth. Reduce the heat and cook at a gentle simmer, partially covered, for 1\u00bd hours, to extract the flavors. Strain, reserving the solids. When the mushrooms are cool enough to handle, squeeze them one by one into the stock to extract the liquid they\u2019ve absorbed, then discard them and the remaining solids.",
    "IT keeps in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months."
