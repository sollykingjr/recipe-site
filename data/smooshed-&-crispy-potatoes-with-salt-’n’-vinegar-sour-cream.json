  "directions": [
    "1. Position a rack in the center of your oven. Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F.",
    "2. Cook the potatoes:- Place 2 pounds baby Yukon Gold in a large pot and fill with 3 quarts water and 1 cup salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Simmer the potatoes until tender and easily pierced with a knife, 5 to 10 minutes. The time will vary depending on the size of your potatoes; be careful not to overcook or they\u2019ll fall apart when smashed. Drain in a colander and let sit for a few minutes to allow some water to evaporate.",
    "3. Smash the potatoes:- Transfer the potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet. Use the bottom of a glass measuring cup or a flat mug to crush each potato until it\u2019s about \u00bd inch thick. Drizzle \u2153 cup olive oil over the potatoes, gently turning them to coat all sides. Taste a potato; if it needs more salt (it probs does), re-season. Top with a few good cranks of black pepper.",
    "4. Roast the potatoes:- Roast until crispy and golden brown on the underside, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the oven and drizzle 3 tablespoons distilled white vinegar evenly over. Flip the potatoes with a spatula and continue to cook until very crisp and golden brown around the edges, 10 to 20 minutes longer. Remove from the oven. Taste and season the potatoes with more salt if they need it.",
    "5. Make the salt \u2019n\u2019 vinegar sour cream:- In a small bowl, stir together \u00be cup sour cream, 3 tablespoons distilled white vinegar, and \u00bd teaspoon salt.",
    "6. Serve:- Spread the sour cream in a shallow bowl or serving platter. Top with the potatoes and a few more cranks of black pepper."
