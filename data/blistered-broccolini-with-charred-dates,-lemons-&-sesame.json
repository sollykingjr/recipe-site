Toss once or twice to coat, then cook undisturbed until charred in spots, 3 to 4 minutes. Toss again and cook another 3 to 4 minutes until bright green and tender.- Turn off the heat. Finely grate 1 garlic clove directly into the skillet and toss to coat. Taste and adjust seasoning. Transfer broccolini and any bits from the pan to a serving plate.- Return skillet to medium heat, add the lemon pieces, torn dates, and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Cook undisturbed until lemons are caramelized and dates darkened, about 2 minutes.",
    "3. Serve:- Scatter the caramelized lemons and dates over the broccolini. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon sesame oil and a good squeeze of lemon juice."
