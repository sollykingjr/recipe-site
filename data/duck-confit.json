  "ingredients": [
    "6(11-ounce) duck legs, trimmed of excess fat",
    "1tablespoon kosher salt",
    "\u00bcteaspoon pepper",
    "10sprigs fresh thyme",
    "4bay leaves, crumbled",
    "6\u20138cups duck fat"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1  Sprinkle duck legs evenly with salt and pepper. Toss with thyme sprigs and bay leaves in large bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours.",
    "2  Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Lay legs, skin side up, in single layer in Dutch oven and arrange thyme sprigs and bay leaves over top. Melt duck fat in medium saucepan over medium heat until liquefied, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour melted duck fat over legs until they are just covered.",
    "3  Transfer pot to oven and bake, without moving legs, until skin has rendered most of its fat, meat is completely tender, and leg bones twist easily away from meat, about 3 hours (fat will be bubbling gently). Being very careful of hot fat, transfer pot to wire rack and let cool completely, about 2 hours. (At this point, with legs covered completely in fat, pot can be wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 1 month; if desired, transfer cooled legs to smaller airtight container and pour cooled fat over top to cover completely.)",
    "4  To serve duck legs on their own, remove them from fat and scrape off as much fat as possible. Lay legs, skin side down, in 12-inch nonstick skillet and cook gently over medium-low heat until skin is crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Gently flip legs and continue to cook until heated through, 4 to 6 minutes. Serve immediately."
