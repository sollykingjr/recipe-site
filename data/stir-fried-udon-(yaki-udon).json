  "directions": [
    "1. For the noodles: Place the udon in a colander and run under hot water to defrost the noodles. Alternatively, put them in a bowl and microwave for 1 minute. Set aside while you prep the vegetables.",
    "2. For the vegetables: Place the cabbage and carrot in a microwave-safe container and zap them for 2 minutes. If you\u2019ve managed to locate some shimejis, cut off the bottoms and separate the mushrooms. If you\u2019re using oyster mushrooms, give them a quick rinse and slice them into \u00bd-inch-wide strips.",
    "3. For the sauce: Stir all the ingredients together in a bowl; set aside.",
    "4. Set a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add the pork belly or bacon. Saut\u00e9 until the meat is mostly cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.",
    "5. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the scallions and bell pepper and cook until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Follow with the mushrooms and cook for 2 minutes. Finally, add the microwave-softened cabbage and carrots and cook until you start to see some browning along the edges of the vegetables, 3 to 4 minutes more. Scoop the pork and vegetables into a bowl and set aside. Give the pan a quick wipe with a paper towel and return it to the stove.",
    "6. Turn the heat up to high and coat the pan with the sesame oil. Add the udon and saut\u00e9 until you begin to see some crisp edges on the noodles, about 2 minutes. Add the pork and vegetables and toss to combine. Add the sauce and toss to coat. Leave the pan on the heat for another minute to thicken the sauce, then fold in the katsuobushi and serve."
