    "16thin slices baguette",
    "Chili Oil (this page)",
    "Mayonnaise",
    "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat the broiler to low (or if you just have one broiler setting, position the oven rack so it\u2019s not right under the broiler).",
    "Brush one side of the toasts with a bit of chili oil (the bread will drink in the oil), then spread each toast with a light layer of mayo and season with salt and pepper to taste. Broil on a baking sheet until golden and toasty, watching the broiler so the bread doesn\u2019t burn, 1 to 3 minutes depending on the broiler."
