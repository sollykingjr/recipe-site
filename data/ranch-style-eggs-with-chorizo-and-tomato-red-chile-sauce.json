    "1. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until it reaches 350 degrees F as measured on a deep-frying thermometer.",
    "2. Fry the tortillas, one at a time, until just crispy, 20 to 30 seconds. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels and season lightly with salt.",
    "3. Heat a large nonstick saut\u00e9 pan over high heat. Add the chorizo and cook until golden brown on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towels.",
    "4. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the rendered fat from the pan. Add the butter to the pan, and once it melts, reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the eggs and the chorizo, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until soft curds form, 3 to 4 minutes.",
    "5. To serve, place a teaspoon of the sour cream in 4 large shallow bowls to secure the tortillas. Place a fried tortilla on top of each dab of sour cream. Spread 2 tablespoons of the sour cream over the top of each tortilla and top with some of the eggs. Ladle the warm tomato-red chile sauce over and sprinkle with the cheese. Top with some avocado and cilantro. Serve immediately."
