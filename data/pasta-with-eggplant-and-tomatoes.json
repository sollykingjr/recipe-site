    "1. Pour at least 2 inches (5 cm) of vegetable oil into a wide heavy-bottomed pot and heat over medium heat until it is hot enough to fry in (see Deep-Frying). Set a wire rack in a sheet pan.2. Once the oil is ready, carefully lower as many eggplant cubes as will fit without crowding into the hot oil. Fry, flipping occasionally, until golden brown all over, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried eggplant to the rack to drain. Sprinkle with salt. Repeat to fry the remaining eggplant cubes.3. Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente. Drain.4. Transfer the pasta to a large serving bowl, along with the warmed sauce and half of the grated ricotta salata and half of the basil. Toss gently to combine.5. Pile the fried eggplant over the pasta and top with the remaining grated ricotta salata and basil. Serve at once."
