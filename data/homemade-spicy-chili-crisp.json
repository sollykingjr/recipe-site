  "directions": [
    "1. Put on disposable latex gloves.",
    "2. Place a wire rack inside a quarter- or half-sheet tray. Using your hands and kitchen shears, cut open chilies and place them on rack. Shake rack to sift off most of the seeds (don't worry about removing all the seeds). Transfer chilies to a bowl and discard seeds.",
    "3. Using a spice grinder and working in batches, process chilies until they are ground to a size just larger than standard chili flakes. Transfer processed chilies to a heatproof bowl or pot large enough to accommodate bubbling oil (at least 4 quarts in size). Combine chili flakes with peanuts, ginger, black pepper, star anise, cardamom, cumin, Sichuan peppercorn, mushroom powder, salt, MSG (if using), and sugar. Set aside.",
    "4. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a 2-quart heatproof bowl. In a 4-quart saucepan, combine oil and shallots. Cook over high heat while constantly stirring. Once shallots become light golden brown, strain. Pour oil back into pot and add garlic. Cook over medium-low heat, constantly stirring, until light golden brown, then strain. Return oil to pot once more. Set aside fried shallots and garlic.",
    "5. Heat oil to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Pour hot oil over chilies, spices, and other seasonings. Stir well to distribute hot oil throughout. Set aside to fully cool, about 30 minutes or until bowl or pot is cool to the touch.",
    "6. Once chili-and-oil mixture has fully cooled, remove star anise and cardamom pods. Mix in fried shallots and garlic. Pour finished chili crisp into jars and store at room temperature for about 3 months. It can be served immediately, but for best flavor, eat it the next day. Stir well before serving."
