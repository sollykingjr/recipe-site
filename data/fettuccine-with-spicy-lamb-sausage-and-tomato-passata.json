  "directions": [
    "1. To make the sugo, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
    "2. Place the lamb bones in a heavy roasting pan. Roast until golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour.",
    "3. Transfer the bones to a heavy sauce pot or Dutch oven. Add the onion, fennel bulb, garlic, coriander seed, chile flakes, peppercorns, fennel seed, and tomato juice to the pot. (You\u2019re essentially making a lamb stock with tomato instead of water.)",
    "4. Slowly bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook until the flavors have melded, about 1 hour.",
    "5. Remove from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh strainer while still warm. Season with salt q.b. Measure out 700g / 3 cups sugo and set aside. Transfer the remainder to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 1 month for another use.",
    "6. To make the sausage, combine the lamb, fennel seed, peppercorns, coriander, granulated garlic, and salt in a bowl and mix well. Make a small patty to test your seasoning.",
    "7. Place a small saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Add the test patty and cook, turning once, until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Check your seasoning and add more salt to the sausage mixture q.b. Refrigerate until ready to use.",
    "8. To finish, following the instructions for fettuccine on this page, make 624g / 1 lb 6 oz with the pasta dough.",
    "9. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Generously salt the water.",
    "10. Place a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat and add the olive oil. Add the sausage and, as it starts to brown, break it up with tongs or a wooden spoon into very small, uniform crumbled pieces. Cook until caramelized and cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes.",
    "11. Add the sugo to the pan with the sausage and cook for 3 to 5 minutes longer.",
    "12. Add the fettuccine to the water and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until tender but not soft.",
    "13. Using tongs or a pasta basket, remove the pasta from the pot and transfer to the saut\u00e9 pan. Turn up the heat to medium. Toss for 1 to 2 minutes to marry the pasta and the sauce. If the sauce begins to tighten, add a splash of pasta cooking water to loosen and continue tossing to marry. The sugo should nicely coat the pasta without clumping.",
    "14. Divide the pasta into bowls and garnish with the lemon peel and pecorino."
