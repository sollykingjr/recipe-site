  ],
  "directions": [
    "Bring a pot of water to a boil and season generously with salt. Meanwhile, set up an ice bath with plenty of ice and water, as you want your noodles thoroughly chilled.",
    "Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and plunge into the ice bath. Give them a stir with your fingers or a pair of chopsticks and allow to cool for a minute or two. Pull the noodles out of the ice bath, deposit them in a strainer, and give them a good shake to get rid of as much water as possible, then divide between two bowls.",
    "Top each serving of noodles with a big spoonful of daikon. Use the back of the spoon to press a little crater into the daikon in each bowl, then nest an egg yolk in it. Sprinkle the scallions on top and tuck a pile of katsuobushi into each bowl. Pour half the dipping broth into each, garnish with a dab of wasabi if you like, and serve immediately."
