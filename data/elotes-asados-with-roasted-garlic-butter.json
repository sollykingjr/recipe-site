  "directions": [
    "Start a charcoal or gas grill. The gas should be set to high. If using a pellet grill, preheat your grill to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) for at least 15 minutes. If using charcoal, the coals should be red but entirely covered with gray ash.",
    "Lay the garlic on a square sheet of aluminum foil, brush with the butter, and wrap tightly.",
    "Place the corn and wrapped garlic directly on the grill. Grill the garlic for about 40 minutes, undisturbed. Grill the corn for about 45 minutes, flipping once. Remove both from the grill.",
    "In a bowl, mix the mayonnaise, coriander, salt, and lime juice. Add the pulp of the roasted garlic by squeezing the head like you would squeeze a lime. Stir to combine.",
    "Pull back the husks from the top down. Spread the garlic mayonnaise all over each ear with a brush and sprinkle the cotija cheese all over the mayonnaise. Finish with a sprinkle of ground chile all around. Serve whole, or cut each corn on the cob into thirds."
