  "ingredients": [
    "1bunch Lacinato kale (8 ounces), thinly sliced",
    "2tablespoons fresh lemon juice (about 1 lemon)",
    "Extra-virgin olive oil",
    "\u00bdpreserved lemon, homemade (see this page) or store-bought",
    "2garlic cloves, grated",
    "1cup fresh basil leaves, chiffonade cut (see this page)",
    "\u00bdcup roasted, salted pistachios",
    "1ounce Pecorino Romano cheese",
    "Diamond Crystal kosher salt",
    "Freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Add the kale to a large bowl. Drizzle with the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon olive oil and massage it into the kale for 1 to 2 minutes. Set the bowl aside.",
    "2. Finely chop the preserved lemon into almost a paste. Add this and the garlic to the bottom of a second large bowl. Add the basil and kale and give everything a mix.",
    "3. Chop the pistachios as finely as possible (think: bread crumbs) and add them to the bowl. Grate in the Pecorino (I use Olive Garden rules: stop whenever you\u2019re ready), drizzle in 1 tablespoon olive oil, and mix again.",
    "4. Taste and season with salt and black pepper, as needed, but it shouldn\u2019t need much."
