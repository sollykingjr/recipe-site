  "directions": [
    "1   Following the instructions for spaghetti alla chitarra on this page, make 624g / 1 lb 6 oz with the pasta dough, substituting ramp tops for half of the spinach.",
    "2   Heat a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-low heat and add the olive oil. Add the ramp bottoms and gently cook them, stirring occasionally, until soft but without color, 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside.",
    "3   Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Generously salt the water.",
    "4   Add the spaghetti alla chitarra to the water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until tender but not soft.",
    "5   While the pasta is cooking, place the saut\u00e9 pan with the ramp bottoms over low heat. Add the butter and 3 ladles (170g / \u00be cup) pasta cooking water. Swirl the contents of the pan to emulsify.",
    "6   Using tongs or a pasta basket, remove the pasta from the pot and transfer to the saut\u00e9 pan. Turn the heat up to medium. Toss for 1 to 2 minutes to marry the pasta and the sauce. If the sauce begins to tighten, add a splash of pasta cooking water to loosen and continue tossing to marry.",
    "7   Turn off the heat. Add the ramp tops, lemon peel and juice, and chile flakes to the saut\u00e9 pan and continue tossing to combine.",
    "8   Divide the pasta into bowls and shave the ricotta salata on top."
