  "ingredients": [
    "Basic_Beans (this page)",
    "1pound orecchiette pasta",
    "5ounces Parmesan cheese, freshly grated (about 1\u2154 cups)",
    "3cups kale, stems removed, coarsely chopped",
    "Calabrian chili paste, for serving",
    "Freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Follow the Basic_Beans recipe until the beans are 15 minutes away from being done. They\u2019ll be soft but will still have a slight al dente bite to them.",
    "2. Remove the onion, rosemary, bay leaf, and garlic. Bring the pot of beans back to a gentle boil, add the orecchiette, and cook for 6 to 7 minutes. Set aside \u00bd cup of the Parmesan for serving. Turn the heat to medium-low.",
    "3. Add the rest of the Parmesan \u00bd cup at a time to the beans and stir constantly to let the cheese melt in with the pasta. The whole pot should begin to thicken.",
    "4. When the cheese is fully combined in the pot, turn off the heat and add the kale. Stir to let the kale wilt into the pasta.",
    "5. Scoop into individual bowls and dot on Calabrian chili paste to taste. Serve topped with some of the reserved Parmesan and black pepper."
