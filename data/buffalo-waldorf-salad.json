  "directions": [
    "To pickle the celery: Put the celery in a small heatproof bowl. In a small pot, bring the rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and \u2153 cup water to a boil, stirring so the sugar dissolves. Pour the boiling liquid over the celery, give it a stir, and let it cool to room temperature. It\u2019s good to go and keeps in the fridge for up to 1 month.",
    "To make the dish: Set up a cooling rack or line a baking sheet with paper towels. Get 2 inches of oil to 350\u00b0F in a heavy pot over medium-high heat. While it\u2019s heating up, combine the sugar and salt in a small bowl. In a medium bowl, combine the seltzer and flour and gently whisk it together until it\u2019s smooth. Pop this batter in the fridge until the oil\u2019s ready.",
    "When you\u2019re ready to fry, core the apples, then slice them into half-moons that are somewhere between \u215b and \u00bc inch thick.",
    "Working in four batches, dip the apple slices, one by one, in the batter, then carefully add them to the oil. Fry, flipping them once with tongs halfway through and trying your best to separate any that stick together, until they\u2019re light golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes per batch. Move them to the cooling rack or prepared baking sheet and season with the sugar-salt mixture, then repeat with the rest of the batches.",
    "Once the apples are all fried and seasoned up, move them to a platter. Spoon the Frank\u2019s over them and top with the candied walnuts, blue cheese, pickled celery (but not the liquid), and scallions. Grind on some pepper and serve with the bottle of Frank\u2019s on the table for anyone who\u2019s feeling extra spicy.",
    "Candied Walnuts: Get your oven to 350\u00b0F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper (for easy cleanup). Lightly coat the paper with nonstick spray, if you\u2019ve got some, to make your life a little easier after cooking.",
    "Combine the walnuts, corn syrup, sugar, and 1 cup water in a medium pot, set it over high heat, and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and cook at a pretty active simmer until the simmer-bubbles get big (a few should be about an inch wide), 15 to 20 minutes. Immediately strain the walnuts, discarding the syrupy liquid and tossing the walnuts a bit to drain off any excess. Transfer the walnuts to the baking sheet, sprinkle the salt on top, and bake them in the oven until they turn a nice copper brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven.",
    "When the walnuts are cool enough to handle, transfer them to a storage container. If you didn\u2019t use nonstick spray, just get in there with a thin spatula to help them release from the parchment.",
    "These guys can be stored at room temp for up to 1 week."
