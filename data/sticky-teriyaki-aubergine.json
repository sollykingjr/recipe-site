  "ingredients": [
    "1large eggplant (14 oz)",
    "4scallions",
    "1fresh red or yellow chili",
    "\u00beoz unsalted peanuts",
    "2tablespoons teriyaki sauce"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Put a 10-inch non-stick frying pan on a high heat and pour in 1 cup of water. Halve the eggplant lengthways, quickly slash the flesh of each half a few times and place skin-side up in the pan, then season with sea salt and black pepper. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, or until it boils dry and begins to sizzle (listen for the change in sound). Meanwhile, trim the scallions. Cut the whites into 1\u00bc-inch lengths at an angle and put aside. Seed the chili and finely slice lengthways with the green part of the scallions. Place both in a bowl of ice-cold water and put aside to crisp up.",
    "When the eggplant starts to sizzle, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the white scallions, and the peanuts to the pan, stirring regularly. After 2 minutes, add a splash of water, drizzle in the teriyaki, and reduce to a medium heat. Turn the eggplant, jiggle the pan and let it get sticky for a few minutes, then dish up, sprinkled with the drained green scallions and chili."
