  "directions": [
    "Make the dressing: In a blender, combine the mayonnaise, lemon juice, \u00bc cup water, both oils, the parmesan, roasted garlic puree, anchovy, grated garlic, sugar, colatura, salt, and pepper and blend on high speed until incorporated. You should have about 1 cup dressing. Set aside. (The dressing may be made up to 3 days ahead.)",
    "Make the salad: First, to prepare an ice bath using a salad spinner, place 2 cups of ice and 8 to 10 cups water in the bottom of the spinner and place the basket on top of the ice, submerged in the water. (Set the lid aside for now.) To clean chrysanthemum greens, pick the leaves (discard any that are bruised) from the stalks and place them into the basket in the ice water. Discard the stalks.",
    "Allow the greens to sit in the ice water for at least 10 and up to 20 minutes. Pull the basket with the greens out, discard the ice and water, return the basket of greens to the spinner, and spin the greens dry. (Alternatively, if you don\u2019t have a salad spinner, use a sieve set in a large bowl to create the ice bath, then drain the ice water and dry the greens very well with paper towels.)In a small bowl, combine the sesame seeds and garlic bread crumbs.",
    "In a large bowl, toss the greens with the lemon juice, olive oil, and salt. Place the dressed greens in a loose pile on a serving platter or individual plates. Drizzle the dressing deliberately and slowly over the top of the greens to dress them evenly. Top with the sesame/bread crumb mixture. Grate the parmesan with a Microplane over the top of the salad to shower the entire dish in a small mountain of cheese.",
    "Serve immediately. The dressing and bread crumbs can be made ahead, but the assembled salad dish is best eaten straightaway."
