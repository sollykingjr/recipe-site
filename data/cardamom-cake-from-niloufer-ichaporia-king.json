  "directions": [
    "Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Prepare a 9-inch springform pan: If you want to be absolutely sure that the topping won\u2019t stick, use a parchment paper disk to line the bottom of the pan before buttering and sugaring it. Butter the pan liberally, sprinkle in 2 to 3 tablespoons of sugar (depending on how sweet and crackly you\u2019d like it), and shake and tap the pan until the bottom and sides are coated with sugar. Don\u2019t worry about extra sugar on the bottom. Cover the bottom with sliced almonds if you want a particularly crunchy topping\u2014or, as an alternative, Ragnhild also suggests ground almonds or bread crumbs.",
    "Using a stand mixer, a handheld beater, or a powerful and patient arm, cream the eggs and sugar until thick and pale and tripled in volume, about 5 minutes. Melt the butter in a little saucepan. Bruise the cardamom seeds in a mortar. With a rubber spatula, quickly fold the flour and salt into the egg and sugar mixture, followed by the butter and the cardamom. Give the batter a thorough stir before tipping it into the prepared pan. Thump the pan on the counter to settle the batter.",
    "Bake the cake until the top feels dry to the touch and springs back when lightly pressed, and a skewer or knife inserted into the center comes out dry, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave in the pan for about 5 minutes. Run a knife around the sides of the pan before inverting the cake onto a rack to cool. Remove the bottom of the pan carefully while the cake is still very warm. Let cool before serving."
