  "ingredients": [
    "1large cauliflower (look for one that\u2019s especially dense)",
    "2\u00bdtablespoons Shawarma Spice Rub (page 24)",
    "1teaspoon honey",
    "\u00bccup (60 ml) blended oil (equal parts extra-virgin olive oil and vegetable oil)",
    "1teaspoon kosher salt",
    "Chilled yogurt",
    "Tahini sauce (see pages 114\u2013117)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Trim the bottom part of the cauliflower so it sits upright on the counter. Using a large sharp knife, slice it horizontally into \u00be-inch-thick (2 cm) slices. The slices on the sides will be smaller and might crumble\u2014no need to worry about that. You should still be able to get 6 or 7 nice steaks.",
    "Stir together the shawarma rub, honey, oil, and salt in a wide, shallow bowl or tray and coat the cauliflower steaks with the mixture, making sure they are coated on all sides. Let them sit in the mixture for 30 minutes to absorb the flavors.",
    "To roast: Heat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Line one or two baking sheets with parchment paper. Arrange the steaks in a single layer. Roast until tender and nicely browned around the edges, about 30 minutes.",
    "To grill: Make sure the grill is clean. Heat it to high heat.",
    "Carefully arrange the cauliflower steaks on the grill. Grill until they are nicely browned and tender but retain some bite, 3 to 4 minutes on each side.",
    "Serve at once, with some chilled yogurt or tahini sauce alongside."
