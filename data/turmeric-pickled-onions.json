    "1large sweet onion, sliced about 1\u20444 inch (6 mm) thick",
    "1tablespoon black peppercorns",
    "1teaspoon yellow mustard seeds",
    "11\u20442 cups (360 ml) apple cider vinegar",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Place the onion in a 1-quart (1 L) mason jar or similar airtight container.2. Heat the peppercorns and mustard seeds in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Toast until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.3. Add the vinegar, sugar, salt, turmeric, and chile to the pan, and increase the heat to medium. Heat just until the sugar and salt dissolve, about 5 minutes. The liquid doesn\u2019t have to come to a full boil.4. Pour the warm liquid over the onions in the jar, packing them down so they are just about covered by the brine. The more they sit, the more they will settle into the brine. Let cool to room temperature and then cover and place in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours.5. Serve, or store in the refrigerator for up to 2 months."
