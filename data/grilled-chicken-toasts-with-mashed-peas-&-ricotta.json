  "directions": [
    "MAKE THE MASHED PEAS AND RICOTTA: In a medium bowl, combine the peas, ricotta, lemon zest, shallot oil, mint, and salt and pepper to taste. Mash with a potato masher until chunky-creamy.",
    "MAKE THE DRESSING: In a screw-top jar, combine the shallot oil, lemon juice, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. Shake to combine.",
    "GRILL THE CHICKEN AND TOASTS: Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.",
    "Brush the chicken with 1 tablespoon of the shallot oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove to a plate, cool slightly, and slice against the grain into \u00bc-inch-thick slices.",
    "Brush each slice of bread with 1 tablespoon of the shallot oil and grill the toasts until golden, 2 to 3 minutes, flipping occasionally so the bread doesn\u2019t burn. Season the oiled side with salt and pepper.",
    "TO SERVE: Divide the mashed peas between the 2 grilled toasts, then fan half the chicken on top of each toast. Season with more salt and pepper. Drizzle with the dressing, top with crispy shallots, and garnish with mint and lemon zest."
