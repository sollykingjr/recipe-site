  "ingredients": [
    "1tablespoon plus \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt (see Note)",
    "6ounces (half of a 12-ounce box) pastina",
    "1tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil",
    "\u00beteaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
    "\u2154cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese",
    "\u00bdcup mascarpone cheese",
    "4tablespoons (\u00bd stick) unsalted butter"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water plus 1 tablespoon of the salt to a boil over high heat. Add the pastina and cook until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Reserving \u2153 cup of the cooking water, drain the pasta and return to the pot along with the cooking water.",
    "Add the oil, remaining \u00bd teaspoon salt, the black pepper, parmesan, mascarpone, and butter. Over medium-high heat, stir vigorously with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon until incorporated, 2 to 3 minutes. As the pastina comes to a boil, the starch will release from the pasta, and it should become very thick and creamy, like risotto.",
    "Serve immediately. This dish is best made and eaten day-of, but if you do have leftovers, reheat them in a pan over low heat with a few tablespoons of water to make the pastina creamy again."
