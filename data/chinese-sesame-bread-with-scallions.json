  "ingredients": [
    "2 1/2cups all-purpose flour",
    "1tsp sugar",
    "1tsp vegetable oil plus additional for oiling pan",
    "1tsp salt",
    "1cup lukewarm water",
    "1tsp instant yeast",
    "1cup chopped scallions",
    "4tbsp white sesame seeds"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "In a large bowl, add flour, sugar, oil, salt, water, yeast. Using the dough hook attachment of your stand mixer, combine ingredients until dough comes together and then knead on low speed for 2-3 minutes. The dough will be quite sticky. You can also do this by hand, which is how my mom did it.",
    "Lightly grease another large bowl. Gather dough and place into the greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.",
    "Lightly flour a large pastry board or flat surface. Roll dough out. Spread scallions across the surface. Then, roll the dough back up, with the scallions folded on the inside (see photos). Form the roll into a spiral. Carefully use the rolling pin on the spiral, rolling and flattening until it becomes a large round disc. (An alternative method: My mother's method was to grease a large plate and roll dough out with scallions directly onto the plate. This method works but you won't have as many layers.)",
    "Sprinkle both sides with sesame seeds, so that the exterior has a sesame crust. I used about 2 tbsp per side. Let dough rest for about 20 minutes.",
    "Using an oversized pot or pan, add oil and preheat. Once the oil is hot, slide your bread into the pot/pan. Cook each side for about 7 minutes on medium high heat until both top and bottom develop a brown crust and the inside is fully cooked. Slice and serve. Bread is best enjoyed warm."
