    "4large organic oranges",
    "\u00becup (150 g) superfine sugar"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Using a vegetable peeler, carefully pare away the zest, taking as little pith as possible, from 2 oranges. Cut this zest into matchstick-size lengths and cover it with cold water in a small pan. Bring to a boil and cook for 7 minutes to remove the bitterness, then drain and set aside.",
    "Now, working with a sharp knife, pare off the white pith from the zested oranges, and remove the peel and pith from the other ones. Set the oranges aside.",
    "Make a syrup by dissolving the sugar in about \u2154 cup water over low heat, then increasing the heat and boiling until it reduces and forms a syrup that coats the back of a spoon. Roll the oranges in the syrup, letting them sit for about 5 minutes, turning and rolling from time to time so as to soak up as much syrup as possible. Arrange the syrup-soaked oranges on a serving plate.",
    "Put the blanched zest matchsticks in the syrup over medium heat, bring to a boil, and cook until they are transparent but still floppy. Arrange a little pile of caramelized zest on top of each orange, pour the syrup over each one, then chill before serving just so."
