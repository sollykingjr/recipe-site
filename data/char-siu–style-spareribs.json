  "directions": [
    "1. Pulse ginger and garlic in food processor until finely chopped, 10 to 12 pulses, scraping down sides of bowl as needed; transfer to Dutch oven. Whisk in maltose, hoisin, soy sauce, 1/2 cup water, Shaoxing wine, five-spice powder, food coloring, if using, and white pepper. Add ribs and toss to coat (ribs will not be fully submerged). Bring to simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 1 1/4 hours, stirring occasionally.",
    "2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Using tongs, transfer ribs to large bowl. Strain braising liquid through fine-mesh strainer set over large container, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Let braising liquid settle for 10 minutes. Using wide, shallow spoon, skim fat from surface and discard.",
    "3. Return braising liquid to pot and add oil. Bring to boil over high heat and cook until syrupy and reduced to 2 1/2 cups, 16 to 20 minutes.",
    "4. Set wire rack in aluminum foil\u2013lined rimmed baking sheet and pour 1/2 cup water into sheet. Transfer half of ribs to pot with braising liquid and toss to coat. Arrange ribs bone side up on prepared wire rack, letting excess glaze drip off. Roast until edges of ribs start to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip ribs and continue to roast until second side starts to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer ribs to serving platter and tent with foil. Repeat with remaining ribs. Serve."
