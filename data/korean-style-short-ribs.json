    "1For the marinade, mix together all the ingredients in a bowl.2Place the beef rib strips in a large dish. Pour over the marinade and mix together to ensure the ribs are evenly coated. Cover with clingfilm, transfer to the refrigerator and leave to marinate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.3When you are ready to cook, heat a cast-iron griddle pan over a medium-high heat and brush it with the vegetable oil.4Using a pair of tongs, lift the strips of beef out of the marinade, shaking off any excess. Lay the strips flat on the griddle and cook for 2\u20133 minutes on each side until slightly charred (you may need to do this in batches).5_\u00a0\u00a0Remove the rib strips from the pan and leave to cool slightly. Cut the strips at every second bone into smaller pieces to make them easier to pick up and eat.",
