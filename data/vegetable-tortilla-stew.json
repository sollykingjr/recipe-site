    "MAKE THE STEW: In a soup pot, heat the oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion, bell pepper, and jalape\u00f1o and cook, stirring, until the onion is translucent and a teeny bit golden, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, cayenne, 2 teaspoons salt, and \u00bd teaspoon black pepper and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the chicken broth, tomatoes, and beans and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the rice and cook until the stew gets nice and thick, about 15 minutes more. Season with more salt, pepper, and spice, if you want.",
    "MAKE THE TORTILLA STRIPPIES: Fill a small or medium saucepan with a couple inches of oil and heat over medium-high heat. Stack the tortillas on top of each other and cut them into thin strips using a sharp knife. Test the oil by dropping a tortilla strip in; if it sizzles immediately, you\u2019re good to go. A small handful at a time, gently lower the strips into the oil and fry until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Pull them out with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, and salt \u2019em up",
    "To serve, divide the soup among bowls and garnish with cilantro, avocado, cheese, and the tortilla strippies."
