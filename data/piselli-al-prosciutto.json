  "ingredients": [
    "2pounds unshelled fresh peas, or 10\u00bd ounces frozen ones",
    "2garlic cloves",
    "3tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "2ounces pancetta, prosciutto, or bacon, chopped",
    "2tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley",
    "salt and freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "If you are using fresh peas, shell them, and if you have the time (or inclination) pull the stringy thread and thin membrane away from half a dozen of the pods. If you are using frozen peas, thaw them.",
    "Peel and gently smash the garlic with the back of a knife. In a large frying or saut\u00e9 pan, warm the olive oil over medium-low heat and add the garlic and pancetta. Cook until the garlic is fragrant and just colored and the pancetta has rendered its fat. Remove the garlic before adding the peas (and pods if you have them) and turn them so that each pea is glistening with oil. Add the parsley, a grind of pepper, and 4 tablespoons water if you are using fresh peas. Cover the pan, turn the heat down, and cook for 5 minutes if you are using frozen peas, or 10\u201315 minutes if you are using fresh ones. If the water seems insufficient, add another tablespoon, but cautiously: there should be no liquid by the time the peas are tender, just a green-tinted oily sheen. Taste and add the chopped parsley, a grind of black pepper, and salt if necessary, stir again, then serve."
