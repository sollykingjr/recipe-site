    "1. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the tomatoes to the water and boil for 30 seconds. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the tomatoes to a bowl and let cool. Reserve the pot and cooking water for the pasta.2. When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, peel off their skins\u2014they should slip off easily. Chop the tomatoes into large chunks. If the tomatoes are very juicy, you can put them in a colander, sprinkle with salt, and let them drain for a few minutes to get rid of the excess liquid.3. Transfer the chopped tomatoes to a large serving bowl. Add the garlic, basil, and olive oil. If you haven\u2019t already salted the tomatoes, add salt to taste.4. Bring the reserved cooking water back up to a boil and salt it generously. Add the penne to the boiling water and cook until al dente.5. Drain the pasta and add directly to the bowl of tomatoes. Mix thoroughly, season with plenty of pepper, and serve at once."
