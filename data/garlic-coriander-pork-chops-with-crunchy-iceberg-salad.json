  "directions": [
    "Make the pork:1. Use a mortar and pestle or spice grinder to crush the peppercorns and coriander into a coarse powder. Season the pork all over with salt and then the spice mix.2. Mix the Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, syrup, and mirin in a small bowl. Set aside.3. Add the canola oil and garlic to a large skillet, set over medium-low heat, and fry the garlic, stirring often, until lightly golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. The garlic won\u2019t seem very crisp at this point, but it will crisp up when fully cool. Transfer the garlic to a paper towel to drain, and sprinkle with a touch of salt.4. Remove all but about 1 tablespoon of the garlic oil from the pan, and reserve the rest (about 1\u20444 cup/60 ml) to use in the dressing. You\u2019ll use this pan to cook the pork, so don\u2019t get rid of it! (But do turn off the heat.)5. Make the dressing: Place the ginger, scallion whites, carrot, the reserved 1\u20444 cup (60 ml) garlic oil, and the syrup, soy sauce, vinegar, and turmeric in a blender, and blend until very smooth. Season with salt and pepper.6. Cook the pork: Heat the skillet over medium heat. Add the pork chops, and sear the first side until golden brown, 4 or 5 minutes. Flip the chops onto the fat cap, and sear until they are golden and the fat has rendered a bit, 1 or 2 minutes.7. Flip over and cook the second side until the chops are golden and the internal temperature is about 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C), 3 or 4 minutes. Transfer the pork chops to a plate. (They will not be fully cooked at this point.)8. Remove all the oil from the skillet. Reduce the heat to low, and add the reserved Worcestershire sauce mixture and butter. Cook, stirring to scrape up any fond, until the butter is melted and everything is combined and bubbly, 1 or 2 minutes.9. Return the pork to the skillet, and cook, basting with the sauce, until the internal temperature is about 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C), 1 or 2 minutes. Turn off the heat.10. Make the salad: Arrange the iceberg on a platter, and drizzle with the ginger dressing. Top with the scallion greens and carrots.11. Slice the pork off the bone, top with more sauce from the pan and the fried garlic, and serve with the salad on the side."
