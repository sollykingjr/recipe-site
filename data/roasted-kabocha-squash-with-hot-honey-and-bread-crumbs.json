  "directions": [
    "1   To make the bread crumbs, preheat the oven to 200\u00b0F.",
    "2   Spread the bread on a sheet pan and bake until dried out, 30 to 45 minutes. You do not want any color. To test for doneness, smash a shard of bread with the back of a spoon. The interior should be completely dry. Let cool.",
    "3   Once cooled, place the bread in a food processor and pulse until broken down into fine crumbs. You want them to retain some texture, so be careful not to turn them to dust.",
    "4   Place a saut\u00e9 pan over medium-low heat. Add the olive oil and garlic and cook until the garlic perfumes the oil, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the garlic and save for another use.",
    "5   Turn the heat down to low. Line a plate with paper towels. Add the bread crumbs to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from the pan and transfer to the plate to drain. Let cool.",
    "6   Measure out 20g / \u2153 cup bread crumbs and set aside. Transfer the remainder to an airtight container and store in a cool, dry place for up to 1 week for another use.",
    "7   To make the hot honey, mix together the honey, chiles, and chile oil in a small bowl. Measure out 80g / \u00bc cup and set aside. Transfer the remainder to an airtight container store at room temperature for up to 2 weeks for another use.",
    "8   To make the squash, preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.",
    "9   Place a small saucepan over low heat. Add the butter and gently melt. Remove from the heat and stir in the olive oil.",
    "10   Place the squash wedges in a large bowl. Add the butter mixture and toss or stir to coat on all sides.",
    "11   Place the squash wedges, skin side down, on a sheet pan. Arrange the garlic cloves around and on the squash and lay the rosemary and thyme sprigs on top. Sprinkle with salt q.b.",
    "12   Roast the squash until fork-tender and slightly caramelized, about 45 minutes.",
    "13   To finish, transfer the squash to a large bowl, add the vinegar, and gently stir to coat.",
    "14   Transfer the squash to a large serving platter and drizzle with the hot honey. Garnish with the thyme and rosemary leaves, chile flakes, and bread crumbs, then sprinkle with sea salt q.b. to finish."
