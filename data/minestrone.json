  "directions": [
    "Finely dice the onions, carrots, and celery. Gently heat the butter and oil over low heat in a very large, heavy-bottomed pan, add the onion, carrot, and celery, and cook gently, uncovered, until they are soft and fragrant and starting to deepen in color\u2014only just. This will take a good 10 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, dice the potatoes, zucchini, and green beans. Add the potatoes to the soup, stir, and cook gently for 5 minutes. Shred the cabbage, and peel (if fresh) and roughly chop the tomatoes. Add the green beans and zucchini, and after 5 more minutes, add the shredded cabbage. Add the tomatoes, stir, and increase the heat so the contents of the pan bubbles more vigorously for a few minutes. Add 6\u00bd cups water and the Parmesan rind, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a tremulous simmer. Cover the pan and leave it just so for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.",
    "After 1\u00bd hours, add the cannellini beans, stir carefully and firmly, then cook for another 30 minutes. If you find the soup is looking too thick before it has finished cooking, add a little more water. When the minestrone has finished cooking, pick out the Parmesan rind and transfer about a fifth of the soup to a separate bowl. Process it until smooth with an immersion blender before returning it to the rest of the soup.",
    "There are different options for serving it. I generally divide the minestrone in half once I\u2019ve made it, warm up the first day\u2019s half, and add 5\u00bc ounces dried pasta that I\u2019ve cooked in a separate pan until al dente. I then stir in a couple of tablespoons of grated Parmesan, wait 5 minutes, and serve. The next day, while the remaining soup is gently reheating, I toast 4 slices of bread, put them in the bottom of 4 bowls, sprinkle them with grated Parmesan and a little salt, and then ladle over the minestrone."
