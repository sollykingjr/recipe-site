    "- 4 large globe eggplants",

    "- 4 teaspoons gochugaru (Korean chili flakes), or more to taste",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Position a rack near the bottom of the oven and preheat the oven to 450\u00baF.",
    "2. Place the whole eggplants on a large sheet pan with plenty of space between them. Bake on the bottom rack for 30 minutes, or until the skin on the bottom begins to char slightly.",
    "3. Carefully flip the eggplants, taking care not to break the skin, and return the pan to the oven, rotated to encourage even cooking. Bake for another 30 minutes, or until the eggplants are very soft.",
    "4. Let the eggplants cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Carefully transfer them to a cutting board or plate and peel back and remove the skin with your fingers.",
    "5. Using a large sturdy spoon to support the bottoms, move the peeled eggplants to a serving plate or platter.",
    "6. Gently chop each eggplant by slicing crosswise every \u00bc inch or so, stopping about 2 inches from the stem, then repeating in the other direction to make a cross-hatched pattern. The flesh should be very soft and require little pressure.",
    "7. Spoon the garlic sauce over the eggplants, then sprinkle with gochugaru and drizzle with chili oil."
