  "directions": [
    "To make the grits: Combine the milk, salt, and 1\u00bd cups water in a medium pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Whisk the mixture with one hand and pour in the grits with the other; whisk constantly until it returns to a simmer, about 2 minutes. Turn down the heat to low so the grits simmer gently and cook, stirring occasionally, until they\u2019re tender, about 45 minutes. Don\u2019t worry if they look a little dry and sad. They won\u2019t in a minute.",
    "Add the cream cheese, sour cream, butter, Tabasco, and pepper and whisk well to melt the butter and totally mix in the cream cheese. Add more salt and Tabasco until you\u2019re happy. Turn off the heat and cover to keep them warm, if necessary.",
    "To assemble the dish: Spoon the grits into four bowls, then top with the collard greens (plus a little pot likker, if there is any hanging around). Spoon on some salsa macha, spreading it around to distribute the spiciness, then pile on the peanuts and sprinkle on the cilantro. Serve with the lime wedges."
