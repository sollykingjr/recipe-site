  "ingredients": [
    "4ounces (118g) Marcona almonds, plus about 24 whole almonds for topping",
    "1(7 oz / 198g) tube almond paste (not marzipan), coarsely crumbled",
    "\u00bccup sugar (1.8 oz / 50g)",
    "1teaspoon vanilla extract",
    "2large eggs (3.5 oz / 100g)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven and prepare the baking sheet: Arrange an oven rack in the center position and preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.",
    "Make the dough: In a food processor, pulse the 4 ounces (118g) of almonds until coarsely chopped. Add the almond paste, sugar, vanilla, and 1 whole egg and 1 egg white (place the yolk in a small bowl) and process in long pulses until you have a smooth dough. Add 2 teaspoons of water to the yolk, beat with a fork to combine, then set aside to use as an egg wash.",
    "Scoop the dough and top: Transfer the dough to a pastry bag (or a resealable zip-top bag) and snip a 1-inch opening. Pipe the dough onto the prepared baking sheet in 1\u00bd-inch-diameter rounds, spacing them about 1\u00bd inches apart (the cookies will spread only slightly). (Alternatively, you can use a \u00bd-ounce scoop or rounded tablespoon measure to portion dough into uniform mounds.) Use a pastry brush to cover the entire surface of each cookie with a thin layer of the egg wash, then press a whole almond into the center of each cookie.",
    "Bake: Bake the cookies until they\u2019re puffed and golden brown all over, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely on the baking sheet before carefully peeling the cookies off the parchment paper."
