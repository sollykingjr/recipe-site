  "servings": "Kimchi fried rice is a common sight in Korea and in my apartment. Pineapple fried rice is my Thai takeout go-to. One day at Mission, we were trying out a quick-fermented kimchi made with pineapple and suddenly realized we could use it to make a mash-up of the two fried rices. OK, there are actually three represented here, because the sesame seeds and garlic-and-(vegan)-butter combo is ripped from the Benihana classic. If you haven\u2019t made the pineapple kimchi, no stress: Mix equal parts chopped aged cabbage kimchi and crushed fresh pineapple. It\u2019ll still taste great.",

  "ingredients": [
    "- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "- \u00bd cup thinly sliced scallions",
    "- 1 large garlic clove, thinly sliced",
    "- 2 cups drained Pineapple Kimchi",
    "- 1 tablespoon unsalted vegan butter",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. PUT the oil, scallions, and garlic in a wok or heavy skillet, set it over high heat, and let the oil sizzle. Cook until the scallions and garlic are fragrant but not colored, about 2 minutes. Add the kimchi and vegan butter and cook, stirring and tossing, until the kimchi is warmed through, about 1 minute. Turn off the heat.",
    "2. ADD the rice, sesame seeds, and soy sauce and use a wooden spoon or flexible spatula to gently stir, breaking up any clumps but not smashing the grains. In a small mixing bowl, combine the umami salt and pepper and 1 tablespoon warm water, stir to dissolve, and add the mixture to the skillet.",
    "3. TURN the heat to high and cook just until it\u2019s hot through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Season with salt. Sprinkle on the seaweed and gochugaru and serve."
