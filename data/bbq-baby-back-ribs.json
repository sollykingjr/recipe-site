  "directions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.",
    "2. Combine the pepper, salt, and five-spice powder in a small bowl. Generously rub each rack of ribs on both sides with the mixture and wrap each rack in heavy-duty foil.",
    "3. Place the racks on a large baking sheet and cook in the oven for about 2\u00bd hours, until tender. Remove the ribs from the oven and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.",
    "4. Prepare the BBQ sauce: Whisk together the hoisin, vinegar, fish sauce, and soy sauce in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
    "5. In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, add the sugar in an even layer over the bottom and cook over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar just begins to melt. Cook for about 8 minutes, without stirring, until it turns a deep amber color.",
    "6. Slowly (the mixture will bubble) add the hoisin mixture to the caramel and continue whisking until smooth. Whisk in the shallots, garlic, ginger, and five-spice powder and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking, whisking occasionally, for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 10 minutes. The BBQ sauce can be made up to 5 days in advance and stored in a container with a lid in the refrigerator.",
    "7. Once the ribs are cool, cut them into individual ribs, transfer to a large baking sheet, and toss them with 1 cup of the BBQ sauce.",
    "8. Preheat a grill to high or a grill pan over high heat. Grill the ribs on each side until slightly charred, about 2 minutes per side, brushing with more of the glaze.",
    "9. Transfer the ribs to a large platter and garnish with crispy garlic, scallions, and cilantro. Serve with additional sauce on the side."
