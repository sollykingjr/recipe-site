    "1. Whisk together the coconut milk, curry paste, fish sauce, brown sugar, salt, and turmeric in a large bowl until smooth. Add the chicken and toss well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours.",
    "2. Remove the chicken from the marinade and lightly blot with paper towels to remove some of the marinade. Thread each piece of chicken onto a skewer, using three-quarters of the skewer, leaving the bottom half empty so the person has something to hold on to when eating.",
    "3. Preheat the grill to high or a grill pan over high heat. Put the skewers on a baking sheet and drizzle with some of the oil. Grill until cooked through and charred on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter and serve with the peanut sauce on the side. Serve with rice of your choice."
