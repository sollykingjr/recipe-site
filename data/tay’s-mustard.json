  "ingredients": [
    "1cup distilled white vinegar",
    "1cup white sugar",
    "One 4-ounce tin Colman\u2019s mustard powder",
    "1tablespoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal or about half as much Morton)",
    "3eggs"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Combine the vinegar, sugar, mustard powder, salt, and eggs in a medium heatproof bowl and whisk until smooth.",
    "Pour an inch or so of water into a small saucepan, bring it to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower the heat to medium-low. Set the bowl in the saucepan (without touching the water). Start stirring right away and keep at it, using a rubber spatula to frequently stir and scrape the sides so the eggs don\u2019t have the chance to scramble, until the mixture thickens to a consistency that\u2019s a bit looser than your average Dijon mustard, about 15 minutes. Give it a good whisk to get rid of any clumps.",
    "Take the bowl off the pan, let the mustard cool, then cover and refrigerate until it\u2019s fully chilled, 1 hour or so. It\u2019ll thicken a bit more.",
    "Use it now or keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 weeks."
