    "Pumpkin Ganache\u25cf Spread both cans of pumpkin on a parchment lined baking sheet and roast at 325 forabout 20 - 30 minutes. Color should darken by two shades and be well reduced.

    "\u25cf Continue cooking the sugar over medium heat. This is a nothing-then-all-at-once sort ofthing -- your mixture will stay clear for a million years, then seemingly out of nowhere itwill start to turn golden. This is the point where you need to pay close attention or riskburning all of your hard work. This may take 8 - 10 minutes, maybe more.",
