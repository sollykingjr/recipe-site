    "- 2 tsp minced ginger",
    "- 2 tsp minced garlic",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. In a medium glass bowl, soak the vermicelli in hot water for about 10 minutes, until softened. Drain and set aside.",
    "2. In a large nonstick pan with a lid over medium-high heat, heat about 1 Tbsp of oil. Add the ginger, garlic, and scallions and quickly stir-fry for about 30 seconds. Add the pork and fry for about 1 minute, stirring to break up into small chunks. Add the doubanjiang, light and dark soy sauces, chili crisp, and sugar, and continue to stir-fry for another minute, until the pork is evenly coated in the seasonings.",
    "3. Add the vermicelli to the pan and pour in the stock. Stir the noodles around and fold the pork and aromatics into the noodles. Place the lid on the pan and cook for about 2 minutes, until the stock has mostly evaporated and the noodles are fully cooked through. Using tongs or a spatula, stir everything one more time to combine all the flavors. When you lift the noodles, every strand should be an even golden-brown color, and there should be bits of pork sticking to the strands. That\u2019s how you will know it\u2019s done.",
    "4. Transfer everything to a plate and top with the scallions. Serve immediately with rice."
