  "directions": [
    "1 Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F. (I use my toaster oven, which works great.) Line a baking sheet with foil.",
    "2 Combine the beef, egg, onion, ketchup, panko, and salt in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Stuff the mixture into the peppers. There should be enough to fill each half-pepper generously, with some of the mixture brimming over the top by about \u00bd inch.",
    "3 Arrange the peppers on the baking sheet and bake until they have softened and the meat is cooked through, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together a 50:50 blend of ketchup and Bull-Dog sauce. Top the cooked peppers with a few generous spoonfuls of sauce and serve."
