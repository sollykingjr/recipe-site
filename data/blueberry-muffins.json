  "ingredients": [
    "5tablespoons (70 grams) unsalted butter (cold is fine)",
    "\u00bdcup (100 grams) granulated sugar",
    "Finely grated zest from \u00bd lemon",
    "\u00becup (175 grams) plain unsweetened yogurt or sour cream",
    "1large egg",
    "1\u00bdteaspoons baking powder",
    "\u00bcteaspoon baking soda",
    "\u00bcteaspoon fine sea or table salt",
    "1\u00bdcups (195 grams) all-purpose flour",

    "3tablespoons (35 grams) raw (turbinado) sugar"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Line a muffin tin with 9 paper liners or spray each cup with a nonstick spray. Melt the butter and pour into the bottom of a large bowl, and whisk in the granulated sugar, lemon zest, yogurt, and egg until smooth. Whisk in the baking powder, baking soda, and salt until fully combined, then lightly fold in the flour and berries. The batter will be very thick, like a cookie dough. Divide between the prepared muffin cups and sprinkle each muffin with 1 teaspoon turbinado sugar. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the tops of the muffins are golden and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean (you know, except for blueberry goo). Let the muffins cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then the rest of the way on a rack.",
    "These, like most muffins, are best on the first day. But we\u2019ve found\u2014through extensive \u201cresearch\u201d\u2014that if you heat them split open under a broiler on day two with a pat of salted butter, they are so good that you\u2019re going to forever hope for more blueberry-muffin leftovers."
