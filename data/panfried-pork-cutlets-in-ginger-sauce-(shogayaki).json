  ],
  "directions": [
    "Slice the tenderloin into 12 pieces of equal size. If using presliced cutlets, skip to the next step. Cover each piece with plastic wrap and pound into a \u00bc-inch-thick cutlet using a meat mallet or rolling pin.",
    "Whisk together the ginger, soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sugar in a bowl. Place the flour in a separate bowl.",
    "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and coat with 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Working in batches, dredge the cutlets in flour, shake off excess, and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Add more oil between batches as needed.",
    "Lower heat to medium and add the onion. Season with salt and cook, stirring often, until wilted and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Remove and set aside.",
    "Pour the sauce into the pan and scrape up any browned bits. Return the cutlets to the pan, overlapping as needed. Top with the cooked onion. Bring to a simmer, gently shaking the pan so the sauce touches all the cutlets. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes.",
    "Serve with steamed rice."
