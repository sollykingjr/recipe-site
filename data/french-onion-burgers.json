  "directions": [
    "1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Combine thyme, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Divide ground beef into 4 lightly packed balls, then gently flatten into \u00be-inch-thick patties. Using your fingertips, press the center of each patty down until about \u00bd inch thick, creating a slight divot.",
    "2. Season patties with the thyme mixture. Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over high heat until just smoking. Using a spatula, transfer patties to the skillet, divot side up, and cook until well browned on the first side, 2 to 4 minutes. Gently flip patties and continue to cook until well browned on the second side, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer patties to a rimmed baking sheet, divot side down, and bake until burgers register 120 to 125 degrees (for medium-rare) or 130 to 135 degrees (for medium), 3 to 8 minutes. Transfer burgers to a platter and let rest for 5 minutes.",
    "3. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack 6 inches from the broiler element and heat the broiler. Arrange buns on a clean rimmed baking sheet, cut sides up, and broil until lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Transfer bun bottoms to a plate. Spread onion jam over bun tops, then top evenly with Gruy\u00e8re. Broil until Gruy\u00e8re is melted and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Serve burgers on buns, topped with fris\u00e9e."
