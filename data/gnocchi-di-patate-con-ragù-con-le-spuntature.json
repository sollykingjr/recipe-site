  "directions": [
    "Dice the onion. Warm the oil in a deep saut\u00e9 pan or heavy-bottomed frying pan over medium heat and add the onion and ribs. Fry the ribs gently for about 20 minutes, turning them regularly until they are light brown on all sides.",
    "Add the tomatoes, a good pinch of salt, and some black pepper. Cover the pan and leave it to simmer gently over low heat, stirring every now and then, for 1 hour, or until the sauce is richly flavored, thick, and the meat tender. Keep the sauce and ribs warm.",
    "To cook the gnocchi, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a fast boil. Warm a large shallow serving dish and make sure you have the warm sauce and ribs and a slotted spoon at the ready. Drop the gnocchi into the boiling water. As soon as they bob to the surface, which will take a matter of minutes, scoop them from the water with the slotted spoon and into the serving dish. Spoon over the sauce, tossing the gnocchi gently to coat, arrange"
