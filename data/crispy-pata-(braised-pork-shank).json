  "directions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.",
    "2. Put the pork shanks in a large pot and add enough cold water just to cover. Add the soy sauce, vinegar, salt, sugar, garlic, bay leaves, star anise, and peppercorns and cook in the oven until just tender but not falling off the bone. Begin testing after 1\u00bd hours; it should take close to 2 hours.",
    "3. Once the shanks are cooked, take them out of the liquid and put them on a baking sheet with a rack. Let cool at room temperature until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes then remove the bones. Place in the refrigerator, uncovered, to air-dry overnight.",
    "4. Heat the oil in a wok or high-sided saut\u00e9 pan until it registers 350 degrees F on a deep-fry thermometer. Fry the shanks, in batches if needed, for about 7 to 10 minutes, until golden brown and crispy. Slice and serve on a platter garnished with crispy garlic and cilantro leaves. Serve with soy dipping sauce, liver sauce, and pickled green mango on the side."
