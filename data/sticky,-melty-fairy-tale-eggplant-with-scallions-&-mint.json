  "ingredients": [
    "1\u00bdpounds fairy tale eggplants",
    "Diamond Crystal kosher salt",
    "1tablespoon white sesame seeds",
    "Extra-virgin olive oil",
    "3tablespoons kecap manis",
    "2tablespoons sambal oelek",
    "2scallions, thinly sliced",
    "15fresh mint leaves, roughly torn"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Remove the tops from the eggplants (don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll still be cute) and halve them lengthwise. Lightly score the flesh in a crisscross pattern, being sure not to cut too deep. Season each cut side with a pinch of salt and let them sit for 5 to 10 minutes, then pat off any moisture droplets with a paper towel.",
    "2. Set a large pan over medium heat and toast the sesame seeds until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the seeds to a small bowl.",
    "3. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to the pan. Working in batches, add the eggplants cut-side down first, and cook until darkened and soft, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Add more olive oil as needed for subsequent batches, since eggplants soak up oil like a sponge.",
    "4. When the eggplants are caramelized all over, leave the last batch in the pan, turn off the heat, and add the kecap manis and sambal oelek. Cook for only a minute, stirring together so the two sauces combine. Toss all the eggplant back in and stir into a sticky pile."
