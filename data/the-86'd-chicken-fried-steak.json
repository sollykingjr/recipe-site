  "directions": [
    "To prep the steak: One by one, put the steak slices between pieces of plastic wrap, put them on a cutting board, and use a meat mallet, rolling pin, or bottom of a small sturdy skillet to evenly pound the hell out of them, so they\u2019re very thin (like, \u215b inch at most). It\u2019s totally OK if they get holes or tear a bit.",
    "Grab two medium mixing bowls. Pour the buttermilk into one. In the other, stir together the flour, garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, kosher salt, onion powder, and chicken bouillon.",
    "One by one, toss the steak slices in the flour mixture, patting to make sure each is evenly coated. Next, shake off any excess coating and submerge in the buttermilk. Let any excess drip back into the bowl and toss the steak in the flour mixture again, patting to evenly coat. As they\u2019re done, put the slices on a plate. They\u2019re ready to fry now, but they can hang out, uncovered, in the fridge for up to 12 hours.",
    "To assemble the sandwiches: Get 2 inches of oil to 350\u00b0F in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Line a baking sheet with a wire rack or paper towels.",
    "Working in two batches, fry the steaks, flipping them once, until they\u2019re golden brown and super-crispy, like fried chicken, 5 to 6 minutes per batch. When they\u2019re done, use tongs to move them to the baking sheet and season immediately on both sides with the chicken salt. (Sneak a bite and add more chicken salt, if you want.)",
    "Get a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet or griddle good and hot over medium heat. Swipe the butter on each side of the bread and toast in batches in the skillet until both sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. When they\u2019re done, move them to a rack or stand them up so they lean against each other to keep from getting soggy.",
    "Generously swipe bird sauce on four of the toasted bread slices and swipe a generous amount of pepper jelly on the other four. Top each pepper jelly\u2013slathered slice with \u00bd cup coleslaw, then the steak, then some pickle chips. Add the bird sauce\u2013slathered slices and get wild."
