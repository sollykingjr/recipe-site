  "ingredients": [
    "2sticks unsalted butter (8 oz / 227g), at room temperature",
    "1pound (454g) full-fat cream cheese, preferably Philadelphia, at room temperature",
    "Generous pinch of kosher salt",
    "1pound (454g) powdered sugar (about 3\u00bd cups), sifted if very lumpy",
    "Seeds scraped from 1 vanilla bean or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Make the frosting: In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and cream cheese on medium-high, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally, until the mixture is completely smooth. Turn off the mixer, add the salt and all of the powdered sugar, and cover the bowl of the mixer with a clean kitchen towel (to shield you from powdered sugar plumes). Pulse the mixer on low several times to incorporate the sugar, then remove the towel and beat the frosting on medium-high, scraping down the sides once or twice, until the frosting is light, thick, and very smooth, about 1 minute. Beat in the vanilla seeds. The frosting is now ready to use."
