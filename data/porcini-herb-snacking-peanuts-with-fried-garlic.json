  "directions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Line a sheet tray with parchment paper.2. Heat the olive oil and garlic in a small saut\u00e9 pan over medium-low heat. Fry the garlic, stirring often, until lightly golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. The garlic won\u2019t seem very crisp at this point, but it will crisp up when fully cooled.3. Using a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the garlic to a paper towel\u2013lined plate to drain. Remove the oil from the heat, and set aside.4. Add the peanuts, reserved garlic oil, mushroom powder, thyme, rosemary, salt, sugar, and pepper to a large bowl. Toss to coat the peanuts in the oil and spices and then transfer them to the sheet tray.5. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the peanuts smell toasty and are slightly browner, tossing halfway through the baking time.6. Let the peanuts cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes, and then stir in the reserved fried garlic and toss on the sheet pan.7. Serve, or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days."
