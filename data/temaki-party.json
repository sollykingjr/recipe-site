  "ingredients": [
    "Rice",
    "As I noted earlier, properly cooked and seasoned rice is an under-appreciated component of sushi in the States. That being said, on most nights that we host a temaki party, I go the easy route and serve unseasoned short-grain rice that\u2019s been cooked in a rice cooker, and it works great. Two cups of raw rice should make plenty for six people. But if you want to make proper sushi rice, see this recipe.",
    "Nori",
    "It\u2019s honestly very difficult to tell the difference between various brands of nori from the packages. Eventually you\u2019ll find a kind you like, but it may take some trial and error to land on one that\u2019s aromatic and crisp, rather than lifeless and papery. If your options are limited, just buy what you can get\u2014even packages of presliced, seasoned seaweed squares will be fine.",
    "If you\u2019re working with whole sheets of nori, cut each piece into quarters and give each person about 10 squares to start. If you\u2019re so inclined, you can toast each sheet of nori before slicing by waving it over an open flame for 10 to 15 seconds. Don\u2019t get too close or linger too long over the flame, or the nori will shrivel and burn. But don\u2019t be too shy either, or the seaweed won\u2019t pick up any toasty flavor.",
    "Fillings",
    "Provide your guests with a nice mix of cooked and raw protein, plus plenty of fresh herbs and veggies. It doesn\u2019t take much to fill a temaki, but you want to have enough of each filling so that everyone can have a taste. As for what to buy, the world is your oyster. Pick whatever you and your family like. As a guideline, here\u2019s what I would set out for six people:",
