  "directions": [
    "TO MAKE THE SAUCE: In a sauce pot over medium heat, add vegetable oil and grated garlic. Cook until fragrant but not browned, then add red wine vinegar, pomegranate juice, granulated sugar, white rice vinegar, cranberry juice, apple cider vinegar, sichuan chili bean paste, ketchup and honey. Bring to a boil and continue to cook for about 1 hour until the mixture is reduced down by a little more than 1/2, and becomes syrupy in consistency. Mix tapioca flour and water until even, then slowly drizzle into the sauce while stirring constantly. Once the mixture is evenly incorporated, cook for another 10 min until thickened. Can be made up to a day before.",
    "TO FRY THE CHICKEN WINGS: Season all sides of the chicken wings with about a heaping 1/2 tsp of salt and a generously dusting of ground white and black pepper. Let marinate for at least 2 hours to 6 hours in the fridge.",
    "Add enough canola oil into a frying-pot until it reaches 2\" deep then set over medium-high heat until it comes to 350 F/175 C (or until it bubbles immediately around an inserted wooden chopstick). Meanwhile, whisk tapioca flour, garlic powder, salt, ground white and black pepper together in a large bowl. Drench the wings evenly in the mixture, dusting off any excess and let sit for 6~8 min for the flour to hydrate, then drench again for a second coating (this gives the a really nice and crispy crust). Fry in the oil in small batches until light golden browned (tapioca breading will not get as much color as wheat flour), then set aside on a cooling rack to drain.",
    "TO FINISH COOKING: In a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat, add vegetable oil, dried chili and shallots. Cook until the chili has darkened in color and smells fragrant. Add the grated garlic and cook until fragrant but not browned. Turn the heat down to medium-low. Add the fried chicken wings and the General Tsao's sauce (just enough to coat). Turn and cook until all the wings are nicely coated and hot. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve immediately."
