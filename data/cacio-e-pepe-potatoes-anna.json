    "1tablespoon (10 grams) potato starch or cornstarch",
    "\u00bdteaspoon fine sea salt, or to taste",
    "\u00bdteaspoon finely ground black pepper, or a larger amount coarsely ground",
    "2 to 3tablespoons (30 to 45 grams) butter, melted, or olive oil",
    "2pounds (roughly 1 kilogram) Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, cut into \u215b-inch-thick rounds, ideally on a mandoline",
    "salad",
    "8cups (5\u2154 ounces or 160 grams) loosely packed arugula",
    "1tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil",
    "2teaspoons (10 ml) white wine vinegar"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "assemble the potatoes Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Combine the cheese, potato starch or cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a small dish. Taste a pinch; you want it to have a strong salty-peppery kick, because it\u2019s going to be distributed all over the galette.",
    "Pour 1 tablespoon butter or oil into the bottom of a 9-inch-diameter cast-iron or ovenproof pan, and swirl it up the sides. Arrange the potatoes in overlapping concentric circles in a single layer at the bottom of the pan. (This will use approximately a quarter of your sliced potatoes.) Drizzle with 1 teaspoon butter or oil, and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the cheese-pepper mixture. Repeat four times, or until the potatoes are used up; you should have about 1 tablespoon cheese-pepper mixture left over; reserve this.",
    "to bake Lightly coat a piece of foil with nonstick spray and tightly cover the pan with it. Put in a heated oven for 35 minutes, at which point the potatoes will be almost tender. Using pot holders, press firmly on the foil to compact the potatoes a bit. Remove and reserve the foil and bake for 25 to 30 minutes more, until lightly brown all over. Press again with the foil, remove, then briefly run under the broiler for an even golden brown finish.",
    "to finish and serve While the galette bakes, toss the arugula with the olive oil and vinegar, keeping the dressing very light.",
    "Once the galette is out of the oven, let it rest in the skillet for a few minutes before running a knife around to ensure that it is loose. Gently tip the skillet over your sink to drain any excess butter or oil. Invert it onto a plate or cutting board, then flip right side up. Cut the galette into wedges, then top with the dressed greens, and sprinkle with the reserved cheese-pepper mixture.",
    "do ahead This galette can be made up to 3 days in advance. Rewarm at 350 degrees for 15 minutes with foil on top."
