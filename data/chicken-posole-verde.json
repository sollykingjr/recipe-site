Stir in garlic and oregano and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in 4 cups broth, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to simmer. Nestle chicken into pot and add any accumulated juices. Cover, transfer pot to oven, and cook until chicken is tender and registers at least 175 degrees, about 1 hour.",

Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve."
