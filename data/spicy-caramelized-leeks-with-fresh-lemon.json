  "directions": [
    "1 Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F.2 Place the leeks cut side down and, without cutting through to the root, slice them lengthwise into \u00bc-inch strips. (You\u2019ll have a leek that looks like a streamer or palm fan). Place leeks in a 9 by 13-inch baking dish or on a rimmed baking sheet.3 Whisk the olive oil and harissa together, then massage into the leeks, getting into all their layers. Season with salt and pepper and lay them straight-ish.4 Roast, without disturbing too much so that they keep their long, wild shape, until they start to fry and sizzle and brown at the ends, 20 to 25 minutes.5 Remove from the oven and transfer to a serving bowl or platter. Top with the lemon and flaky salt before serving."
