  "ingredients": [
    "about 1\u00bd pounds zucchini",
    "about \u2154 cup extra-virgin olive oil (depending on size of pan)",
    "2garlic cloves",
    "salt",
    "1scant tablespoon red wine vinegar",
    "1small handful mint leaves"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Wash and dry the zucchini and slice them into \u00bc-inch slices. Place the slices on a clean tea towel, pressing each one gently into the cloth, and leave to dry out\u2014on a hot day you could leave them in the sun for a few hours, otherwise in the sunniest spot in the kitchen or a very cool oven\u2014for a few hours.",
    "Warm a generous \u00be inch cm olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Put a single layer of zucchini slices in the oil and fry, turning the slices once, for about 5 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Lift out with a slotted spoon, shaking it slightly over the pan to allow some of the oil to drip away, then park them first on paper towels to blot, then into a shallow bowl. Continue frying the zucchini in batches and transferring them, via paper towels, to the bowl.",
    "Peel and slice the garlic into thin batons, add it to the zucchini, and sprinkle them with salt and vinegar. Some people like to pour over a little more olive oil at this point. Tear the mint leaves into small pieces and add these too. Using a spoon, or better still your hands, mix everything together. Eat immediately or wait a few hours for the flavors to sharpen and the dish to become tarter and, I think, even better."
