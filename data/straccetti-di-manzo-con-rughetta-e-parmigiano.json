  "ingredients": [
    "10\u00bd\u201314ounces lean steak, such as rump, very thinly sliced with the grain (I ask my butcher to do this, or you can freeze it to help you slice it very thinly)",
    "extra-virgin olive oil, for marinating and cooking",
    "salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "a bunch of arugula",
    "Parmesan, to serve",
    "lemon wedges, to serve"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Tear the steak into smallish pieces (rags) and put them in a bowl. Pour over a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, season with salt and pepper, toss well with your hands, and leave to sit for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, wash and dry the arugula and divide it between 2 plates.",
    "Warm 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat, add the beef and the oily juices from the bowl, and saut\u00e9 briskly until it is just colored, but still a little pink in places, which will take a matter of seconds. Divide the meat between the plates, spooning over any juices, then use a vegetable peeler to pare curls of Parmesan over the beef and arugula. Pour over a little more olive oil if you think it needs it, and serve with a wedge of lemon."
