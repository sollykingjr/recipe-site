  "directions": [
    "1 Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Place brioche on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake until brioche is almost dry throughout (center should remain slightly moist), about 16 minutes, flipping bread halfway through baking. Remove brioche from rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees and return sheet with wire rack to oven.",
    "2 Whisk milk, egg yolks, sugar, melted butter, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt together in large bowl. Transfer mixture to 13 by 9-inch baking dish.",
    "3 Add brioche to dish and soak until slices are saturated with milk mixture but not falling apart, 20 seconds per side. Using firm slotted spatula, transfer brioche to second baking sheet, allowing excess milk mixture to drip back into dish.",
    "4 Melt \u00bd tablespoon butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Using slotted spatula, transfer 2 slices soaked brioche to skillet and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until second side is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes longer. (If toast is browning too quickly, reduce temperature slightly.) Transfer to prepared wire rack in oven to keep warm. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels. Repeat in 3 batches with remaining 1\u00bd tablespoons butter and remaining 6 slices soaked brioche.
