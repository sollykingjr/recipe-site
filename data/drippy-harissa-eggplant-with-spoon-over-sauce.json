  "ingredients": [
    "1large eggplant (1\u00be pounds)",
    "\u2153cup spicy harissa paste (I love Mina or New York Shuk)",
    "2tablespoons soy sauce",
    "1tablespoon Worcestershire sauce",
    "1tablespoon light brown sugar",
    "Extra-virgin olive oil",
    "4thick slices sourdough bread",
    "\u2154cup Sourdough Bread Crumbs (this page)",
    "Diamond Crystal kosher salt",
    "\u00bccup fresh dill, finely chopped",
    "\u00bccup fresh chives, finely chopped",
    "1lemon, for squeezing (optional)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 425\u00b0F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.",
    "2. Halve the eggplant lengthwise. Score the flesh of the eggplant diagonally, then place the halves flesh-side down on the lined sheet pan. Roast the eggplant until the skin is charred and it looks a bit collapsed, 40 to 45 minutes.",
    "3. While the eggplant is roasting, in a small bowl, whisk together the harissa, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, and \u2153 cup water. Set aside.",
    "4. Set a deep saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Pan-fry the bread slices, toasting until golden, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove the bread and add the bread crumbs to the pan, toasting them for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally so as not to burn. Season with salt and transfer the bread crumbs to a small bowl and carefully wipe out the pan.",
    "5. When the eggplant is finished roasting, scrape the flesh out of the skin into a bowl (discard the skin and stem). Place the saut\u00e9 pan back over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the eggplant flesh and the harissa mixture and mix everything together with a spatula to coat. Bring the sauce to a simmer and simmer for 5 to 6 minutes to thicken slightly. Remove the pan from the heat. Scatter the bread crumbs evenly over the eggplant but don\u2019t mix them in.",
    "6. To serve, scoop a generous helping of crumb-topped eggplant onto each slice of bread and spoon over any remaining sauce in the pan. Sprinkle with the chopped dill, chives, and a squeeze of lemon juice (if using) and serve."
