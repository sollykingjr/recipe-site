  "directions": [
    "In a large frying pan over medium heat, add the oil. When hot, fry the chiles in batches, starting with the guajillos, cooking them until they change color and turning once so they don\u2019t burn, about 2 minutes. Remove to a plate.",
    "Next, fry the chiles de \u00e1rbol, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove to a plate with the guajillos.",
    "In the same oil, fry the serrano chile, onion, and garlic until the onions are translucent and a slight char has formed around the garlic and serrano, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and reserve on the plate.",
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the tomatillos. Lower the heat and allow them to simmer until the tomatillos have changed color and cooked through, about 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the tomatillos to an ice bath to cool.",
    "In a food processor or blender, add all of the chiles, the onion, garlic, tomatillos, and salt and blend until smooth.",
    "Taste for salt, adding more as needed, and serve."
