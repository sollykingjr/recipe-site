  "ingredients": [
    "1oz dried porcini mushrooms",
    "10oz ground pork",
    "1onion",
    "10oz dried whole-wheat penne",
    "1\u00beoz Parmesan cheese"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "In a small bowl, cover the dried porcini with 1\u2154 cups of boiling kettle water. Place the ground pork in a large shallow casserole pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then break it up and fry on a high heat, stirring regularly. Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion, then the drained porcini, reserving the soaking water.",
    "Stir the onion and porcini into the pan and fry for 10 minutes, or until golden. Add 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar and the porcini water (discarding the last gritty bit). Simmer for 10 minutes on a low heat while you cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the package instructions, draining 1 minute early and reserving a good cupful of cooking water.",
    "Toss the drained pasta into the pork pan with 1 cup of reserved cooking water, then finely grate in most of the Parmesan, taste, and season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Toss over a low heat for 2 minutes to emulsify the sauce, then dish up. Finely grate over the remaining Parmesan, drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, and enjoy."
