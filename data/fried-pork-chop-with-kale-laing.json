  "directions": [
    "In a cold pot add in sliced bacon and cook over medium low heat until crispy. Add a touch of oil to get it going, if you\u2019d like. About 7-10 minutes.",
    "Once bacon is rendered, add in leeks, garlic, ginger, and chiles. Cook, stirring occasionally until leeks have softened. About 10-12 minutes.",
    "Add in shrimp paste and toast until aromatic, about 1 minute.",
    "Pour in coconut milk and coconut cream and bring to a boil.",
    "Add in kale and bring to a simmer. Mix occasionally to prevent burning. Cook until kale has softened and stems can break with the back of your spoon. The color of the kale should be a deep dull green. There shouldn\u2019t be a lot of liquid, reduce if necessary. If sauce is too thick add in water 1 Tbsp at a time. Season with salt or fish sauce at the end to prevent it from being too salty.",

    "In three separate bowls, prepare your breading station.",
