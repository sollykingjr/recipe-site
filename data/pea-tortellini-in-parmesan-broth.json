  "directions": [
    "make the broth Place all the ingredients in a large wide pot and simmer, partially covered, for 1 to 1\u00bd hours. Strain the broth; you should have about 8 cups.",
    "meanwhile, make the tortellini In a food processor or blender, pulse the peas with the ricotta, Parmesan, salt, pepper, zest, and juice until the peas are chopped but not fully pur\u00e9ed, scraping down the bowl once or twice. Taste, and adjust the seasonings. If you don\u2019t have a food processor or blender, simply mash the peas well in a bowl before stirring in the other ingredients.",
    "Trim the stack of wonton wrappers down to 2-inch squares. (The scraps make impromptu/makeshift fresh noodles.) Get a small dish of water you can dip your fingers into. Place one wonton wrapper near it on your work surface, and keep the others covered so they don\u2019t dry out. Use your finger to dab water around the circumference. Dollop just about \u00bd teaspoon filling in the middle, then fold the wrapper diagonally over the dough, pressing out as much air as you can as you seal it. Dab the corners with more water and, wrapping them around your small finger, seal them together. Fold down the opposite corner, napkinlike. Repeat with the remaining wonton skins and filling. You may find that placing the filling in a sandwich bag with the corner snipped off to make a makeshift piping bag makes the filling process easier.",
    "finish the soup Bring your broth back to a simmer, and add half the tortellini. Cook until they float to the surface, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the tortellini with a slotted spoon to a bowl briefly as you repeat with second half.",
    "to serve Return the cooked tortellini to the pot and ladle broth over them to rewarm them. Ladle them into shallow bowls, and swirl in a few pea shoots, if using. Drizzle with a little olive oil, and sprinkle with Parmesan.",
