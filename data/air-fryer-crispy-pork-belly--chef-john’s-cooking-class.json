    "Slice the pork belly horizontally and vertically to about 0.5 inches in depth.",
    "Take a bowl, add in all ingredients of\u3010Seasoning\u3011and mix well.",
    "Evenly spread the seasonings on the pork belly, but do not apply on the pork skin.",
    "Use aluminum foil to wrap the pork belly, leaving the skin on top uncovered. Wipe the skin clean and brush some vinegar and sprinkle a little bit salt. Vinegar will take away the moisture and make it more crispy.",
    "Put the pork belly into the TaoTronics Air-Fryer. Set the temperature to 200\u00b0F/105\u00b0C, cook for 30 minutes until the belly skin is dry. This way, it will get crispy.",
    "Take out the pork belly, apply some salt on the skin, and brush a layer of oil. Place it back into the air-fryer, set the temperature to 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0 and cook for 40 minutes.",
    "Dice it into small pieces, and it's ready to serve."
