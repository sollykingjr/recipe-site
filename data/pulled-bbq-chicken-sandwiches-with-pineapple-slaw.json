  "directions": [
    "MAKE THE PULLED BBQ CHICKEN: Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. In a medium Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering-hot. Add the chicken in one layer (work in batches if you have to) and brown it until golden all over, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and set aside.",
    "Add the onion to the pan and cook, stirring, until golden, 9 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 2 more minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the ketchup, tomato sauce, \u00bc cup water, vinegar, brown sugar, chipotles, mustard powder, \u00bd teaspoon salt, and \u00bd teaspoon pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook uncovered until the sauce is thick, about 4 to 5 minutes.",
    "Return the chicken and any juices to the pan, cover, and simmer until the chicken is very tender, about 1 hour. Add a few splashes of water if necessary to keep it from getting too dry. Remove from the heat and let cool. Shred the chicken with two forks right in the sauce (it will be pretty easy to shred). Keep covered in the Dutch oven until ready to serve.",
    "MAKE THE SLAW: In a big bowl, combine both cabbages, the carrot, scallions, and pineapple. In a separate bowl, whisk together the mayo, vinegar, granulated sugar (if using), salt, and pepper. Pour the dressing over the slaw, toss, and refrigerate until ready to serve.",
    "To serve, mound as much of the pulled chicken and sauce onto each bun as you can handle, and top with some slaw."
