  "directions": [
    "\u2460 Cook the rice:",
    "\u2726Rinse 1 cup long-grain rice in a fine-mesh strainer, swirling the rice with your hands until the water runs clear, 1 to 2 minutes.",
    "\u2726Combine the rinsed rice, 1\u00bc cups cold water, and \u00bc teaspoon salt in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cover the pot immediately with a tight-fitting lid and reduce the heat to very low. Cook 16 minutes (set a timer). Turn off the heat, leave the lid on, and let the rice steam for another 10 minutes; uncover and fluff with a fork.",
    "\u2461 Meanwhile, prep the broth:",
    "\u2726Cut 2 heads of garlic in half crosswise. No worries if they fall apart a bit.",
    "\u2726Thinly slice 1 (4-inch) piece of ginger lengthwise into planks.1",
    "\u2726Cut 4 scallions in half crosswise, separating the dark green parts from the light green and white parts.",
    "\u2726Cut 1 large bunch of cilantro in half, separating and reserving the thick stems from the tender leaves and stems.",
    "\u2462 Poach the chicken:",
    "\u2726Place 2 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts skin-side up in a medium saucepan. Add the halved garlic heads, sliced ginger, dark scallion greens, thick cilantro stems, 4 cups water, and 2 tablespoons salt. The chicken should be just submerged in the water; if it\u2019s not, add more water.",
    "\u2726Bring the water to a simmer over medium-high heat. Using tongs, flip the chicken breasts so they\u2019re skin-side down.2 Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breasts (insert the probe near top part, i.e., the rounded part of the breast) reaches 150\u00b0F. This will take 10 to 20 minutes.3",
    "\u2463 Make the scallion sauce:",
    "\u2726Thinly slice the light green and white parts of the remaining scallions crosswise. Finely chop the cilantro leaves and tender stems.",
    "\u2726Trim the stems of 2 jalape\u00f1os. Cut the jalape\u00f1os in half lengthwise and pull out the seeds and inner ribs. Finely chop the jalape\u00f1os. Combine the scallions, cilantro, and jalape\u00f1os in a small bowl.",
    "\u2726Stir in \u00bc cup olive oil and the juice of 1 lime; season with salt.",
    "\u2464 Back to that chicken:",
    "\u2726Once the chicken reaches 150\u00b0F, use tongs to transfer the breasts to a cutting board and let cool for about 10 minutes. Once cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin. Carve the meat of each breast off the bone and cut each against the grain into \u00bd-inch-thick slices. Here\u2019s a video to help guide you through that process.",
    "\u2726While the chicken cools, add 3 cups water to the broth and return to a simmer. Remove from the heat.",
    "\u2465 Serve:",
    "\u2726Place a big mound of cooked rice in each of 4 serving bowls and top with the chicken breast slices. Ladle some broth over top (no need to strain it; just avoid the big pieces of garlic and scallion floating around).",
    "\u2726Spoon the scallion sauce generously over the chicken. Serve more broth alongside for sipping.4",
