  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Toast the sesame seeds in a small skillet over medium heat until golden brown and smelling like toasted sesame, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the olive oil, lemon, sumac, and thyme, swirling to get everything submerged in the oil. Season with salt and pepper and let gently simmer a minute or two for maximum infusion. Remove from heat and let sit another minute or two.",
    "2 Place the goat cheese in a small dish, glass jar, or other container. Pour the olive oil mixture over and let sit at least 10 minutes, drizzling with more olive oil as needed to kind of submerge slightly (the oil is part of the eating experience and should be spooned onto the cracker or toast as well).",
    "3 To serve, finish with a bit more fresh thyme and a sprinkle of sumac and set out with crackers or slices of toast."
