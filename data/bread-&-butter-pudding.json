  "ingredients": [
    "6tablespoons lightly salted butter, softened",
    "6slices thick white bread",
    "1/3cup mixed dried fruit, such as golden raisins, currants, and raisins",
    "2tablespoons candied peel",
    "3extra-large eggs",
    "1 1/4cups milk",
    "2/3cup heavy cream",
    "1/4cup granulated sugar",
    "whole nutmeg, for grating",
    "1tablespoon demerara sugar or other raw sugar"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Use a little of the butter to grease an 8 x 10-inch baking dish and the remainder to butter the slices of bread. Cut the bread diagonally into quarters and arrange half of them overlapping in the prepared baking dish.",
    "2. Scatter half of the dried fruit and candied peel over the bread, cover with the remaining bread slices, and add the remaining dried fruit and candied peel.",
    "3. Whisk the eggs well in a large pitcher, then mix in the milk, cream, and granulated sugar. Pour the mixture over the bread and let stand for 15 minutes so the bread soaks up some of the egg mixture.",
    "4. Tuck the dried fruit and candied peel under the bread slices so they don\u2019t burn. Grate a little of the nutmeg over the top of the bread, according to taste, and sprinkle over the demerara sugar.",
    "5. Place the dish on a baking sheet and bake at the top of the preheated oven for 30\u201340 minutes, until just set and golden brown. Remove from the oven and serve warm."
