    "Mix together the 1 tablespoon sugar and the pectin in a small bowl. That\u2019s your pectin bomb, and you\u2019re gonna need it toward the end.",
    "Put everything else into a medium heavy pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat and cook at a rolling simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid reduces by about half, 30 minutes or so.",
    "Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer, discard the solids, then return the liquid to the pot. Stir in the pectin bomb, get the mixture boiling again over high heat, then boil, stirring nonstop, until it looks glossy and thickens enough to easily coat the back of a spoon, about 2 minutes. Let it cool completely.",
