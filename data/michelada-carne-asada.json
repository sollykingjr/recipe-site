  "directions": [
    "Whisk together the garlic powder, cumin, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pat the steak dry with paper towels, then sprinkle the rub evenly over both sides of the meat, gently patting to help it stick. Let sit for at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour.",
    "Meanwhile, in a large nonreactive bowl, combine the michelada mix, tomato juice, orange juice, and beer. Submerge the seasoned meat in the marinade and top with the shallot and orange slices. Put the bowl in the refrigerator and allow the meat to marinate for at least 4 hours or overnight.",
    "Remove the meat from the refrigerator to allow it to reach room temperature before grilling, if possible.",
    "Start a charcoal or gas grill. The gas should be set to high. If using a pellet grill, preheat your grill to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for at least 15 minutes. If using charcoal, the coals should be red but entirely covered with gray ash.",
    "Remove the meat from the marinade and put it on the grill directly over the fire. Close the lid and cook, turning once, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Transfer the meat to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes.",
    "Slice the meat against the grain. Serve with warm tortillas and salsa."
