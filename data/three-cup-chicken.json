    "1. Cook vegetable oil and ginger in 14-inch flat-bottomed wok over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until ginger and garlic are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer ginger and garlic to bowl; transfer oil to separate bowl.",
    "2. Heat now-empty wok over high heat until just beginning to smoke. Drizzle reserved vegetable oil around perimeter of wok and heat until just smoking. Add chicken and cook, tossing slowly but constantly, until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add ginger, garlic, and rock sugar and cook, tossing slowly but constantly, until sugar has dissolved, about 1 minute.",
    "3. Stir in water, michiu, soy sauce, and dark soy sauce. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in sesame oil, increase heat to high, and cook, tossing slowly but constantly, until almost all liquid has evaporated and chicken is well glazed, about 2 minutes. Off heat, stir in basil and Fresno chile. Garnish with extra basil leaves before serving."
