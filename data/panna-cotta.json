  "ingredients": [
    "1\u2153cups heavy cream",
    "\u2154cup half-and-half",
    "1vanilla pod",
    "3gelatin leaves",
    "6tablespoons to \u00bd cup superfine or confectioners\u2019 sugar"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "You\u2019ll need 4 metal panna cotta molds or ramekins (which need to be lightly greased with vegetable oil). If you don\u2019t want to turn them out, use 4 glasses.",
    "Pour the cream into a pan. Use a small sharp knife to split the vanilla pod lengthwise, then scrape the seeds out. Add the seeds and split bean to the pan. Warm the cream gently over low heat, but do not allow it to boil. Remove from the heat and set aside for 10 minutes so that the vanilla infuses into the milk.",
    "Soak the gelatin leaves in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes, or until they are very soft and floppy.",
    "Remove the vanilla pod from the pan. Return the pan to low heat, add the sugar, and stir until it has dissolved. Squeeze the water out from the gelatin leaves and add them to the pan. Stir until the gelatin has dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat.",
    "Divide the mixture between your molds or glasses and chill in the fridge for at least 3 hours. To turn them out, dip the base of the molds briefly in boiling water, then invert onto serving plates. Serve just so, or with a spoonful of sharp fruit sauce or coulis."
