    "Start a charcoal or gas grill. The gas should be set to high. If using a pellet grill, preheat your grill to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for at least 15 minutes. If using charcoal, the coals should be red but entirely covered with gray ash.",
    "Wrap the garlic in aluminum foil. Place the wrapped garlic, the onion, and chile manzano on the grill. Cover and cook until everything\u2014except the garlic, which will be tender\u2014is charred, about 15 minutes, turning once. Remove to a plate. Toast the guajillo and pasilla chiles over the grill until aromatic, about 1 minute per side. Remove to the plate.",
    "In a high-speed blender, add the charred onion, garlic, and chiles along with the orange juice, lime juice, vinegar, sherry, oil, piloncillo, cumin, coriander, and salt. Blend until smooth.",

    "Remove the steaks from the marinade and put them on the grill directly over the fire. Close the lid and cook, turning once, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Transfer the meat to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes.",
    "Slice the meat against the grain. Serve with warm tortillas and salsa."
