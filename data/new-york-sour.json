    "Ice",
    "1/2cup (4 ounces) rye whiskey or bourbon",
    "1/4cup (2 ounces) freshly squeezed lemon juice",
    "2tablespoons (1 ounce) simple syrup, plus more to taste",
    "1large egg white (optional)",
    "2 to 3tablespoons red wine"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Place a handful of ice, the whiskey, lemon juice, simple syrup, and egg white (if you\u2019re using it) in a cocktail shaker or a jar with a lid. Shake vigorously until the outside of the shaker or glass is frosty and very chilled. Strain over more ice into two glasses.",
    "Gently place a thin spoon upside-down at the surface of the drink and slowly, in the barest trickle, pour 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons red wine over the back of it, moving it across the drink\u2019s surface as you pour. If all goes well, the wine will stay at the surface of the drink. If it sinks, well, it\u2019s still going to be pretty and delicious. Repeat with the second drink."
