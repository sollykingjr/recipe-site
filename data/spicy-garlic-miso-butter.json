    "You can put the miso butter in a bowl and go to town on it. Or, if you want to be fancy and slice it into discs to put on your steaks, place a piece of plastic wrap over a piece of foil and spread the mixture into a 6 \u00d7 2-inch rectangle on the plastic. Fold the foil over the mixture and roll the foil and plastic over the mixture into a loose log. Using the ends to twist, twist the foil into handles and then keep twisting until the butter is compacted into a 4-inch-long log. Chill until ready to use: 1 hour in the freezer or 4 hours in the fridge.",
    "When ready to serve, just open the log and slice off as many butter discs as you like."
