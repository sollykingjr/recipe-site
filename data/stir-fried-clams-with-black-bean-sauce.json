  "directions": [
    "1. Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok over medium-high heat. Add clams, cover, and cook, shaking wok occasionally to redistribute, until clams open, 3 to 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer clams to a bowl (discard any unopened clams) and cover to keep warm. Discard cooking liquid and wipe wok clean with paper towels.",
    "2. Whisk broth, oyster sauce, cornstarch, Shaoxing wine, and sesame oil together in a small bowl. Heat the now-empty wok over high heat until just smoking, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, drizzle vegetable oil around the perimeter of the wok, and heat until just smoking. Add ginger, douchi, and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in broth mixture, bring to a simmer, and cook until sauce has thickened, about 1 minute. Add clams and Fresno chile and gently toss to coat. Sprinkle with scallion before serving."
