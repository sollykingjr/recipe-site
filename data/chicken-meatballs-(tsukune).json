  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Combine the chicken, onion, ginger, panko, starch, egg white, and salt in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Use your hands to form the mixture into 1-ounce (golf ball\u2013size) balls or torpedoes and set aside.",
    "2. Combine the soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sugar in a bowl and stir to dissolve the sugar.",
    "3. Heat a large nonstick or well-seasoned carbon steel skillet over medium-high heat, then coat with the vegetable oil. Place the meatballs in the pan and cook for 7 to 8 minutes, turning them often so they brown evenly on all sides.",
    "4. When the meatballs are just about perfectly done, turn the heat up and pour the sauce mixture into the pan. Swirl the pan back and forth to coat the tsukune in the sauce, then cook for 3 more minutes, allowing the liquid to reduce and glaze the meat. Serve hot, with a sprinkling of togarashi and raw egg yolks for dipping."
