  "directions": [
    "To make the dressing: Buzz the anchovies, garlic, oil, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, the finely grated zest of 1 lemon, and the juice of 1\u00bd lemons in a blender on high speed until smooth-ish, about 30 seconds. Pour it into a medium mixing bowl, add the mayo and Parm, and mix real well. Taste and add more lemon juice until you\u2019re happy.",
    "The dressing makes about 1\u00bd cups and keeps in the fridge for a couple of weeks.",
    "To make the croutons: Get your oven to 300\u00b0F.",
    "Toss the bun cubes with the oil in a medium mixing bowl to get them all evenly coated. Add the garlic powder, salt, and pepper and toss again.",
    "Spread the cubes evenly on a baking pan and bake them, rotating the pan once halfway through, until they\u2019re Winnie-the-Pooh brown and crunchy to the core, 30 to 40 minutes.",
    "To assemble the salad: Put the romaine in a big honking bowl with 1 cup of the dressing (or more\u2014I like it overdressed) and the juice of the lemon. Use your hands to toss well so the lettuce is nicely coated, then add most of the cheese and the croutons and toss again. Add the rest of the cheese, and go to crank town with a pepper grinder, if you want. Serve with the onion slices, if desired, and those anchovies laying on top, or for dangling over friends\u2019 heads and then slowly lowering into their mouths like I imagine ancient Roman nobility ate grapes."
