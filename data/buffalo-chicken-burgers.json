  "directions": [
    "1. Microwave 4 tablespoons butter, hot sauce, molasses, and cornstarch in bowl, whisking occasionally, until butter is melted and mixture has thickened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes; cover to keep warm and set aside.",
    "2. Break ground turkey into small pieces in large bowl. Add remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter, shallot, Worcestershire, and pepper and gently knead with your hands until well combined. Divide chicken mixture into 4 equal portions, then gently shape each portion into \u00be-inch-thick patty. Using your fingertips, press center of each patty down until about \u00bd inch thick, creating slight divot.",
    "3. Sprinkle patties with salt. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until just smoking. Transfer patties to skillet, divot side up, and cook until well browned on first side, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip patties, reduce heat to medium-low, and continue to cook until browned on second side and meat registers 160 degrees, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer burgers to platter, brush with half of buffalo sauce, and let rest for 5 minutes.",
    "4. Arrange lettuce on bun bottoms. Serve burgers on buns, topped with blue cheese, celery, and celery leaves, passing extra buffalo sauce separately."
