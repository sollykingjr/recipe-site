  "directions": [
    "make the broth Heat the oil or butter in the bottom of your largest pot (8 quarts is ideal here; see note) over medium heat, and add the onions, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they\u2019re browned in spots and a little soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the garlic, parsley stems, peppercorns, bay leaf, and chicken, then the water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, mostly covered, for 25 minutes, then use tongs to remove the chicken from the broth, leaving the broth covered on the lowest heat. As soon as the chicken is cool enough to handle, discard the skin and pick the meat from the bones, covering it and setting it aside until needed. Return the bones to the stock and bring it back to a simmer. Cook, mostly covered, for 1 to 2 hours; less time will make a fine pot of soup; a longer amount of time will make an even more developed flavor.",
    "Pour the soup through a fine-mesh strainer, wipe out your stockpot, and return the broth to it. (You should have about 3 quarts of stock.)",
    "cook the noodles Bring a separate pot of well-salted water to a boil and cook the noodles according to package directions; drain when finished.",
    "finish the soup Meanwhile, bring the soup broth back to a simmer and add salt and pepper to taste\u2014I usually need at least 1 tablespoon kosher salt and \u00bd to 1 teaspoon of pepper adds a nice warmth\u2014then add the additional celery and cook for 5 minutes; then the additional carrots, and cook everything together for 7 to 10 minutes more, or until the vegetables are tender. Add the reserved chicken and noodles, taste again for seasoning and adjust as needed, and heat just to warm through. Ladle into bowls and finish with fresh herbs."
