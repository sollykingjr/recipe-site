  "directions": [
    "make your stock Heat the oil in the bottom of a stockpot (6 to 7 quarts is ideal) over medium-high heat. Add the leeks, onions, carrots, parsnip, celery, and mushrooms, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they\u2019re browned in spots and a little soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the rutabaga, potato, garlic, parsley, dill, peppercorns, cayenne, salt, and bay leaf, then the water and bring to a simmer. Cook, covered, for 45 minutes to 1 hour, then taste and adjust the seasonings as desired. Strain the stock, and set aside.",
    "meanwhile, make the matzo balls Mix all the matzo-ball ingredients in a bowl. Cover, and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Bring well-salted water to a brisk boil in a large, wide pot such as a saut\u00e9 pan, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Run your hands under water so they are thoroughly wet. Form matzo balls by dropping teaspoonfuls (as in, 1 teaspoon measurement or the equivalent tiny scoop) into the palm of your wet hands and rolling them loosely into balls. Drop them into the simmering salt water one at a time. Cover the pot, and cook them for 20 minutes.",
    "assemble the soup Meanwhile bring the stock back to a simmer. About 5 minutes before the matzo balls are ready, add the julienned carrots and parsnips, and let them simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the matzo balls to the pot. Ladle into bowls, and garnish with herbs."
