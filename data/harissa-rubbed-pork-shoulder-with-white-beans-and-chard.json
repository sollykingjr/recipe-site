    "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "\u00bdcup harissa paste",
    "\u00bccup distilled white vinegar",
    "3tablespoons tomato paste",
    "3tablespoons light brown sugar",
    "4garlic cloves, finely grated",
    "1\u00bdcups water",
    "2(15-ounce) cans small white beans, such as cannellini or great northern, drained and rinsed",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "1 Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F.2 Season the pork with salt and pepper and place in a large Dutch oven. Combine the harissa paste, vinegar, tomato paste, brown sugar, and garlic in a medium bowl. Smear the harissa mixture all over pork, getting into all nooks and crannies, and add the water. Place the lid on the pot and roast, until the pork is nearly falling-apart tender, 3 to 3\u00bd hours.3 Remove the lid, add the beans, and season with salt and pepper. Increase the oven temperature to 425\u00b0F and return the pot to the oven, uncovered. Roast until the beans have soaked up all the liquid and the top of the pork is deeply golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.4 Transfer the pork to a cutting board. Add the chard and preserved lemon to the beans and stir to wilt the leaves. Slice pork into \u00bd-inch-thick slices (if it starts to shred, that\u2019s fine). Transfer the beans and greens to a large serving plate or shallow bowl and place the pork on top (alternatively, place pork on top of the beans in the pot and serve directly from there). Scatter with cilantro and serve the lemon alongside for squeezing over."
