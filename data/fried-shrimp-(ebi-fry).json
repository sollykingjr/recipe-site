  "directions": [
    "1. If you want to straighten the shrimp before frying, you can do so in one of two ways: You can run a short bamboo skewer through the length of each shrimp, then remove it after frying. Or\u2014this is my preferred method\u2014you can make a few shallow incisions along the belly (inside curve) of each shrimp, grab it by the tail, and give its back a few gentle whacks against a cutting board to break up the muscle fibers. Place the shrimp on a paper towel to dry.",
    "2. Add the vegetable oil to a deep 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat the oil to 350\u00b0F over medium heat. Line a baking sheet with paper towels or a wire rack.",
    "3. Meanwhile, set up a breading station by lining up three shallow trays\u2014pie tins work well\u2014and filling them with the flour, egg, and panko, respectively. Lightly beat the egg. Working with one at a time, coat each shrimp with flour, gently dusting off any excess, then give it a dip in egg, and, finally, a coating of panko. Set aside on a plate.",
    "4. Fry the shrimp in batches for about 2 minutes, or until the exterior is crisp and golden brown. Drain on the paper towels or wire rack and season lightly with salt. Serve with lemon wedges, sliced cabbage, and whichever sauce(s) you prefer."
