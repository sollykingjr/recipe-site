  "ingredients": [
    "- 1 1/2 cups water",
    "- 1/4 cup Shaoxing wine",
    "- 2 tablespoons soy sauce",
    "- 4 teaspoons sugar",
    "- 2 teaspoons doubanjiang (broad bean chile paste)",
    "- 1 teaspoon cornstarch",
    "- 1 pound Chinese or Japanese eggplant",
    "- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil",
    "- 1 garlic clove, minced",
    "- 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger",
    "- 1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil",
    "- 2 scallions, sliced thin"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Whisk water, Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, sugar, doubanjiang, and cornstarch in a medium bowl until sugar has dissolved. Cut each eggplant crosswise into 3- to 4-inch lengths. Halve each piece lengthwise, then cut each half into 3/4-inch-thick wedges.",
    "2. Heat an empty 14-inch flat-bottomed wok over high heat until just smoking. Reduce heat to medium-high, drizzle vegetable oil around the perimeter of the wok, and heat until shimmering. Add garlic and ginger and cook, mashing mixture into the wok, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Spread eggplant evenly in the wok (pieces will not form a single layer). Pour Shaoxing wine mixture over eggplant and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer gently until eggplant is soft and has decreased in volume enough to form a single layer on the bottom of the wok, about 15 minutes, gently shaking the wok to settle eggplant halfway through cooking (some pieces will remain opaque).",
    "3. Uncover and continue to cook, swirling wok occasionally, until liquid is thickened and reduced to just a few tablespoons, 12 to 14 minutes. Drizzle with sesame oil and sprinkle with scallions. Serve."
