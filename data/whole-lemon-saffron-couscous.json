  "ingredients": [
    "\u00bcteaspoon high-quality saffron threads",
    "2ice cubes (up to 60ml of water)",
    "Extra-virgin olive oil",
    "1lemon, very thinly sliced, seeds removed",
    "1medium yellow onion, thinly sliced",
    "Diamond Crystal kosher salt",
    "2Thai red chilies, thinly sliced",
    "3garlic cloves, thinly sliced",
    "1cup Moroccan couscous"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "1. Use a mortar and pestle to crush the saffron threads. Bloom the saffron by sprinkling the saffron powder over 2 ice cubes. Set this aside and allow the ice cubes to melt while you prepare the rest of the recipe.",
    "2. Set a large, deep saut\u00e9 pan with a fitted lid over medium heat and add 6 tablespoons olive oil. Add the lemon, onion, and a few generous pinches of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion and lemon are softened, 17 to 20 minutes. Pick out any stray lemon seeds as you go.",
    "3. Add the chilies and garlic to the pan and cook until the lemon begins to caramelize and darken, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour in the couscous and give one big mix to ease it into the onion and lemon. Drizzle the saffron water evenly over top. Pour in 1 cup of water and stir to combine. Let this come to a simmer (it should take seconds), then turn off the heat and cover. Let this stand on the stove for 5 minutes.",
    "4. Uncover and fluff the couscous, season with a few large pinches of salt, and mix again."
